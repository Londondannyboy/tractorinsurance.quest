**WASPI** (Women Against State Pension Inequality) is a campaign representing millions of women born in the 1950s who were affected by changes to the State Pension age. Many weren't given adequate notice that their pension age was increasing from 60 to 66.

## What is WASPI?

WASPI is a grassroots campaign group founded in 2015. It represents women born in the 1950s (mainly between 1950 and 1960) who:

- Expected to receive their State Pension at age 60
- Had their State Pension age increased to 65 or 66
- Say they weren't given enough notice to prepare for the change

The campaign argues these women faced financial hardship because they couldn't adequately plan for the extra years without State Pension income.

<Callout type="info" title="Not About Equalisation">
WASPI doesn't oppose equalising State Pension age between men and women. The campaign is about the lack of proper notice given to affected women.
</Callout>

## How Were Women Affected?

Women's State Pension age was gradually increased through several changes:

    { period: "2011 Pensions Act", change: "Further increase to 66", impact: "Both sexes by 2020" }
  ]}
/>

### The Notice Problem

The key issue is that many women claim they:

- Didn't receive letters about the changes
- Only found out close to when they expected to retire
- Had already made retirement plans based on age 60
- Couldn't adjust in time (find work, save more, etc.)

## The Ombudsman's Findings

In March 2024, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) published its final report after a 6-year investigation.

### Key Findings

The Ombudsman found that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP):

1. **Failed to act quickly enough** to notify women of the 1995 changes
2. **Didn't write directly to affected women** until 2009 (14 years after the law changed)
3. **Communication was inadequate** and didn't explain the full impact

<Callout type="warning" title="Maladministration Found">
The Ombudsman concluded there was "maladministration" - failures in the way the DWP communicated the changes - though it stopped short of finding the policy itself was wrong.
</Callout>

### Compensation Recommendations

The Ombudsman recommended compensation at **Level 4** of its guidance, suggesting payments of:

<DataTable
  title="Recommended Compensation Levels"
  columns={[
    { key: "level", header: "Impact Level" },
    { key: "amount", header: "Compensation", highlight: true },
    { key: "criteria", header: "Criteria" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { level: "Moderate", amount: "£1,000", criteria: "Limited impact" },
    { level: "Significant", amount: "£1,500 - £2,000", criteria: "Notable hardship" },
    { level: "Severe", amount: "£2,500 - £2,950", criteria: "Serious injustice" }
  ]}
  caption="Compensation for maladministration, not loss of pension"
/>

<Callout type="important" title="Important Distinction">
This compensation is for the **failure to communicate properly**, not for the actual loss of pension income. It doesn't restore the pension these women lost.
</Callout>

## Government Response

As of January 2025, the government has **not agreed** to pay compensation. The government's position:

- The Ombudsman's recommendations are not legally binding
- Any compensation scheme would need Parliamentary approval
- The cost could be billions of pounds
- Ministers are "considering" the report

### What WASPI Wants

The WASPI campaign is calling for:

1. **Full implementation** of the Ombudsman's recommendations
2. **Fair compensation** for all affected women
3. **A clear timetable** for when payments will be made
4. **Recognition** of the injustice suffered

## Are You Affected?

You may be a WASPI woman if you:

- Were born between **6 April 1950 and 5 April 1960**
- Expected to retire at 60
- Had your State Pension age increased with little notice

- **Lost expected income** - Up to 6 years of State Pension
- **Reduced retirement savings** - Less time to prepare
- **Continued working** - Having to work longer than planned
- **Debt and hardship** - Some struggled to make ends meet
