Understanding how your **NHS Pension** is calculated helps you plan for retirement. This guide explains the calculation method and helps you estimate your future pension.

## How the 2015 Scheme Works

Most NHS staff are now in the **2015 scheme**, which uses **Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE)**:

<StatGrid columns={3}>
  <StatCard
    label="Accrual Rate"
    value="1/54th"

</StatGrid>

### The Basic Formula

**Annual Pension = Pensionable Pay ÷ 54**

This applies each year. Your total pension is the sum of each year's pension, with revaluation applied.

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Work Out Each Year's Pension

For each year of service, divide your pensionable pay by 54.

<DataTable
  title="Example: Building Pension Over Time"
  columns={[
    { key: "year", header: "Year" },
    { key: "salary", header: "Salary", align: "right" },
    { key: "pension", header: "Pension Earned", highlight: true, align: "right" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "Year 1", salary: "£30,000", pension: "£556" },
    { year: "Year 2", salary: "£31,000", pension: "£574" },
    { year: "Year 3", salary: "£32,000", pension: "£593" },
    { year: "Year 4", salary: "£33,000", pension: "£611" },
    { year: "Year 5", salary: "£35,000", pension: "£648" }
  ]}
  caption="Each year's pension = Salary ÷ 54"
/>

### Step 2: Apply Revaluation

Each year's pension is increased by **CPI + 1.5%** at the start of every tax year until you retire.

<Callout type="example" title="Revaluation Example">
If you earned £556 pension in Year 1 and CPI is 2%:

- After 1 year: £556 × 1.035 = £575
- After 2 years: £575 × 1.035 = £595
- And so on...

This compounding significantly increases early-career pension value.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Add Up All Years

Your total pension is the sum of all revalued years' pension.

## NHS Pension Calculator Examples

### Example 1: Full Career

<Callout type="example" title="Sarah's Career">
**Sarah** works for 35 years in the NHS, starting at £28,000 and finishing at £55,000.

Assuming average career earnings of £40,000 with CPI averaging 2.5%:

- Basic pension accrued: ~35 × (£40,000 ÷ 54) = **~£25,926** (simplified)
- With revaluation compounding, actual pension would be higher
- Estimated pension: **£28,000 - £32,000** per year

*This is simplified - actual calculation accounts for each year individually.*
</Callout>

### Example 2: Mid-Career Professional

<Callout type="example" title="James's Situation">
**James** is 45 and has been in the NHS for 15 years. He earns £50,000 and plans to retire at 67.

**Service so far** (15 years):
- Average salary: £40,000
- Pension built up: ~15 × (£40,000 ÷ 54) = ~£11,111 (before revaluation)

**Future service** (22 more years to 67):
- Assuming average £55,000 salary
- Additional pension: ~22 × (£55,000 ÷ 54) = ~£22,407

**Total estimated**: ~£33,500 per year (before revaluation adjustments)
</Callout>

### Example 3: Part-Time Worker

<Callout type="example" title="Emma's Part-Time Pension">
**Emma** works 3 days a week (0.6 FTE). Her full-time equivalent salary is £40,000, but she earns £24,000.

Her pension for one year:
- Pensionable pay: £24,000
- Pension earned: £24,000 ÷ 54 = **£444**

Part-time service counts at its actual rate, not the full-time equivalent.

## Official NHS Pension Calculator

For accurate personalised estimates, use the official tools:

<ExternalLinkCard

The Member Hub shows:

- Your actual pension built up
- Projected pension at Normal Pension Age
- Impact of different retirement dates

## Lump Sum Options

At retirement, you can exchange pension for a **tax-free lump sum**:

### Exchange Rate

- Give up £1 of annual pension to receive £12 lump sum
- Maximum: 25% of the capital value of your pension

<DataTable
  title="Lump Sum Exchange Examples"
  columns={[
    { key: "pension", header: "Annual Pension" },
    { key: "exchange", header: "Pension Given Up" },
    { key: "lump", header: "Lump Sum", highlight: true },
    { key: "remaining", header: "Remaining Pension" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { pension: "£20,000", exchange: "£2,000", lump: "£24,000", remaining: "£18,000" },
    { pension: "£30,000", exchange: "£3,000", lump: "£36,000", remaining: "£27,000" },
    { pension: "£40,000", exchange: "£5,000", lump: "£60,000", remaining: "£35,000" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Lump Sum Decision">
Whether to take a lump sum depends on your circumstances. The break-even point is roughly 12 years - if you live longer, the higher pension would have been better.
</Callout>

## Early Retirement Reductions

If you retire before your **Normal Pension Age** (State Pension age), your pension is reduced:

<BarChart
  title="Early Retirement Reduction"
  subtitle="Approximate pension reduction by years early"
  data={[
    { label: "1 year early", value: 5, color: "bg-amber-400" },
    { label: "2 years early", value: 10, color: "bg-amber-500" },
    { label: "3 years early", value: 14, color: "bg-orange-500" },
    { label: "5 years early", value: 22, color: "bg-orange-600" },
    { label: "10 years early", value: 40, color: "bg-red-500" }
  ]}
  valueSuffix="%"
/>

### Early Retirement Example

<Callout type="example" title="Early Retirement">
**David** has a pension of £30,000 per year at his NPA of 67. He wants to retire at 62 (5 years early):

- Reduction: ~22%
- Reduced pension: £30,000 × 0.78 = **£23,400**
- Annual loss: £6,600

    {
      question: "How is part-time service calculated?",
      answer: "Part-time service uses your actual pensionable pay, not the full-time equivalent. Working 0.6 FTE for 10 years doesn't equal 6 full years - it's 10 years at your actual salary."
