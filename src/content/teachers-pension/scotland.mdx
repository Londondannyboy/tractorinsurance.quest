Teachers in Scotland have their own pension scheme - the **Scottish Teachers' Superannuation Scheme (STSS)**. While similar to the England and Wales scheme, there are some differences.

## What is the Scottish Teachers' Pension?

The Scottish Teachers' Pension Scheme is a **defined benefit** pension for teachers in Scotland. It's administered by the **Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA)** on behalf of the Scottish Government.

    { earnings: "Over £79,808", rate: "11.9%" }

## How Your Pension is Calculated

The Scottish scheme uses the same **Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE)** method:

**Annual Pension = Pensionable Earnings ÷ 57**

Each year's pension is revalued by **CPI + 1.6%** until retirement.

<Callout type="example" title="Scottish Teacher Example">
**Morag** earns £38,000 teaching in Glasgow.

Her pension for this year:
- Pension earned: £38,000 ÷ 57 = **£667** per year
- This is revalued each year until retirement
</Callout>

## Transferring Between Schemes

If you move between Scotland and England/Wales:

### Moving to Scotland

If you move from an English/Welsh school to Scotland:

- You can transfer your TPS benefits to STSS
- Or keep them in TPS (they'll be paid separately at retirement)
- Consider which gives better outcome

### Moving to England/Wales

If you move from Scotland to England/Wales:

- You can transfer STSS benefits to TPS
- Or keep them in STSS
- Transfer isn't automatic - you must request it

<Callout type="tip" title="Transfer Considerations">
Transferring combines everything in one place. Keeping separate may give flexibility. Consider seeking advice for complex cases.

## Early Retirement in Scotland

The rules for early retirement are similar:

- Minimum age: 55 (57 from 2028)
- Early retirement reductions apply
- Normal Pension Age: State Pension Age

## Death Benefits

The Scottish scheme provides:

- **Death grant**: 3× pensionable salary if you die in service
- **Survivor's pension**: For spouse, civil partner, or nominated partner
- **Children's pension**: For dependent children

## McCloud Remedy in Scotland

Scotland has its own McCloud remedy implementation:

- Same principle as England/Wales
- Affected members get choice for remedy period (2015-2022)
- SPPA is contacting affected members

<Callout type="info" title="Same Outcome">
Although administered separately, the McCloud remedy aims to achieve the same outcome for Scottish teachers as for those in England and Wales.
