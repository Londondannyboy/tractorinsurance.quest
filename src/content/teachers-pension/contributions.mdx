## Teachers' Pension Contribution Rates 2024/25

Your contribution rate depends on your actual pensionable earnings:

  columns={[
    { key: "tier", header: "Tier" },
    { key: "earnings", header: "Annual Salary" },
    { key: "rate", header: "Rate", highlight: true },
    { key: "monthly", header: "Monthly (approx)" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { tier: "1", earnings: "Up to £32,135", rate: "7.4%", monthly: "Up to £198" },
    { tier: "2", earnings: "£32,136 - £43,259", rate: "8.6%", monthly: "£230 - £310" },

## How Your Contribution is Calculated

### Step 1: Identify Your Pensionable Salary

**Pensionable salary** typically includes:

- Basic salary
- Teaching and Learning Responsibility (TLR) payments
- Special Educational Needs (SEN) allowances
- Other contractual allowances

**Usually not included**:

- Overtime (unless contractual)
- Expenses
- Performance bonuses

<Callout type="info" title="Check Your Payslip">
Your payslip shows your "pensionable pay". This is used to calculate your contribution, which may differ from gross pay.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Find Your Contribution Tier

Look at the table above to find which tier your annual pensionable salary falls into.

### Step 3: Calculate Your Contribution

Multiply your pensionable salary by your tier's percentage rate.

### Example Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="Contribution Example">
**Emma** is a main scale teacher earning £38,000 per year.

- Her tier: 2 (£32,136 - £43,259)
- Her rate: 8.6%
- Annual contribution: £38,000 × 8.6% = **£3,268**
- Monthly contribution: **£272** (before tax relief)
</Callout>

## Employer Contributions

Your school or employer also contributes to your pension:

    label="Employer Rate"

</StatGrid>

### Total Combined Contribution Examples

  columns={[
    { key: "salary", header: "Salary" },
    { key: "employee", header: "Employee", align: "right" },
    { key: "employer", header: "Employer", align: "right" },
    { key: "total", header: "Total/Year", highlight: true, align: "right" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { salary: "£30,000", employee: "£2,220 (7.4%)", employer: "£8,604", total: "£10,824" },
    { salary: "£40,000", employee: "£3,440 (8.6%)", employer: "£11,472", total: "£14,912" },
    { salary: "£55,000", employee: "£5,610 (10.2%)", employer: "£15,774", total: "£21,384" },
    { salary: "£75,000", employee: "£8,475 (11.3%)", employer: "£21,510", total: "£29,985" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Value of Your Pension">
The combined contribution of up to 40% is far more than most private employers contribute (typically 3-10%). This makes the Teachers' Pension exceptionally valuable.
</Callout>

## Tax Relief on Contributions

You receive **tax relief** on your Teachers' Pension contributions, meaning your pension costs less than the headline rate.

### How Tax Relief Works

Contributions are taken from your pay **before** income tax is calculated. This gives automatic tax relief.

<DataTable
  title="Real Cost After Tax Relief"
  columns={[
    { key: "rate", header: "Your Tax Rate" },
    { key: "relief", header: "Tax Relief" },
    { key: "cost", header: "Real Cost", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { rate: "Basic rate (20%)", relief: "20%", cost: "80% of contribution" },
    { rate: "Higher rate (40%)", relief: "40%", cost: "60% of contribution" },
    { rate: "Additional rate (45%)", relief: "45%", cost: "55% of contribution" }
  ]}
/>

### Tax Relief Example

<Callout type="example" title="Tax Relief Example">
**James** earns £55,000 and pays higher-rate tax.

- His contribution: £5,610 per year
- Tax relief at 40%: £2,244
- **Real cost to James**: £3,366

He gets a £5,610 pension contribution for £3,366.
</Callout>

## Part-Time Teachers

If you work **part-time**, your contribution rate is based on your **actual earnings**, not the full-time equivalent.

<Callout type="example" title="Part-Time Example">
**Sarah** works 3 days per week (0.6 FTE). Full-time salary would be £40,000, but she earns £24,000.

Her contribution tier is based on **£24,000** (Tier 1 at 7.4%), not £40,000.

This means part-time teachers often pay a lower percentage than full-time colleagues on the same scale.
</Callout>

## Multiple Teaching Jobs

If you have more than one teaching job:

- Each job has its own contribution rate
- Rates based on each job's salary separately
- All jobs count towards your total pension

<Callout type="info" title="Multiple Jobs">
Combined earnings don't affect individual job contribution rates. Each is calculated separately based on that job's salary.
</Callout>

## Supply Teachers

Supply teachers can join the Teachers' Pension Scheme:

- Must be employed by a scheme employer (school, agency)
- Contributions calculated on supply work earnings
- Builds pension at same rate as permanent staff

Check with your agency whether they offer TPS membership.

## Opting Out

You can opt out of the Teachers' Pension, but it's rarely advisable:

### What You'd Lose

- 28.68% employer contribution (essentially free money)
- Death benefits (3× salary lump sum)
- Ill health protection
- Guaranteed inflation-linked pension

<Callout type="warning" title="Think Very Carefully">
Opting out loses you the 28.68% employer contribution - a massive benefit. Most financial advisers strongly recommend staying in.
</Callout>

### If You Do Opt Out

- Complete an opt-out form via My Pension Online
- Your employer stops deducting contributions
- You can rejoin later
- Time out of the scheme means no pension growth

## Contribution Increases

Contribution rates are reviewed periodically. Recent history:

<DataTable
  title="Contribution Rate History"
  columns={[
    { key: "year", header: "Year" },
    { key: "range", header: "Rate Range", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "2015", range: "7.4% - 11.7%" },
    { year: "2019", range: "7.4% - 11.7%" },
    { year: "2024", range: "7.4% - 11.7%" }
  ]}
/>

The contribution rates have remained stable, though salary thresholds are updated.

  items={[
    {
      question: "Why is my Teachers' Pension contribution so high?",
      answer: "Rates range from 7.4% to 11.7% depending on salary. While this seems high, your employer contributes 28.68% on top, and you get a guaranteed pension - making it excellent value."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I reduce my contribution rate?",
      answer: "You can only change your rate by earning less. The rates are fixed by scheme rules. You could opt out entirely, but this isn't recommended."
    },
    {
      question: "Are contribution rates changing?",
      answer: "There are no announced changes to contribution percentages, though salary thresholds are updated periodically."
    },
    {
      question: "Do part-time teachers pay lower rates?",
      answer: "Often yes, because rates are based on actual salary, not full-time equivalent. A part-timer earning £24,000 pays 7.4%, not the rate for the FTE salary."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens during maternity leave?",
      answer: "You continue in the scheme during maternity leave. Contributions are based on actual maternity pay received."
    },
