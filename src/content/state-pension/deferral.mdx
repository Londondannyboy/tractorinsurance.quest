**State Pension deferral** means choosing to delay when you start claiming your State Pension. In return, you receive a higher amount when you do claim. But is it worth it?

## How Deferral Works

When you defer your State Pension:

- You don't receive any payments during the deferral period
- Your State Pension increases by **1% for every 9 weeks** you defer
- This works out to approximately **5.8% per year**
- The increase is for life once you start claiming

## How Much Extra Would You Get?

## The Break-Even Point

When you defer, you "lose" pension payments during the deferral period. You need to live long enough after claiming for the higher amount to make up for this.

### Break-Even Calculation

<BarChart
  title="Years to Break Even After Deferral"
  subtitle="How long until you're better off"
  data={[
    { label: "6 months", value: 17.2, color: "bg-blue-500" },
    { label: "1 year", value: 17.2, color: "bg-blue-600" },
    { label: "2 years", value: 17.2, color: "bg-blue-700" },
    { label: "3 years", value: 17.2, color: "bg-indigo-600" }
  ]}
  valueSuffix=" years"
/>

The break-even point is approximately **17-18 years** regardless of how long you defer. This is because the percentage increase is proportional to the time deferred.

**Example:** If you defer for 1 year:
- You "lose" 52 weeks × £221.20 = £11,502
- You gain £12.83/week extra for life
- Break-even: £11,502 ÷ £667/year = **17.2 years**

<Callout type="tip" title="Life Expectancy">
Average life expectancy at 66 is about 20 years (to age 86). If you're in good health, deferral could be worthwhile. If you have health concerns, claiming sooner may be better.

## When Deferral Makes Sense

Deferring your State Pension may be a good idea if:

### 1. You're Still Working

If you're earning a good income past State Pension age:
- You don't need the State Pension income
- The State Pension is taxable - it may push you into a higher tax bracket
- Deferring reduces your tax bill now

### 2. You Have Other Income

If you have sufficient other income (workplace pension, investments, savings):
- You don't need the State Pension immediately
- Deferral gives you a guaranteed "return" on your money

### 3. You're in Good Health

If you have good life expectancy:
- You're more likely to exceed the break-even point
- The extra income will benefit you for longer

### 4. You Want to Leave More to Family

If you're married/in a civil partnership:
- Your surviving spouse may inherit some of your deferred pension
- The higher amount continues after your death (subject to rules)

## When Deferral Doesn't Make Sense

Deferring probably isn't right if:

### 1. You Need the Money

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't Defer If You Need Income">
If you're struggling financially, claim your State Pension. No increase is worth financial hardship.
</Callout>

### 2. You Have Health Concerns

If your life expectancy is below average, you may not reach the break-even point.

### 3. You'd Use Savings Instead

Don't use up other savings just to defer State Pension. Your savings may be needed for emergencies or care costs.

### 4. You'd Work Longer Just to Defer

If you're only working to avoid claiming State Pension, this usually doesn't make financial sense.

## How to Defer

Deferral is automatic - simply **don't claim** your State Pension when you reach State Pension age.

You'll receive a letter about claiming around 2 months before your State Pension age. If you want to defer:
- Don't respond to the letter
- Your State Pension will automatically be deferred

### How to Start Claiming Later

When you're ready to claim:
- Apply online, by phone (0800 731 7898), or by post
- You can backdate your claim up to 12 months
- Your first payment will include the higher rate

## Partial Deferral

You cannot take a partial State Pension - it's all or nothing. Either you:
- Claim the full amount at State Pension age, or
- Defer the entire amount

<Callout type="info" title="No Flexibility">
Unlike some private pensions, you can't take some State Pension now and defer the rest. It's a binary choice.
</Callout>

## Tax Implications

Your State Pension is taxable income. Deferral affects your tax in two ways:

### During Deferral

- You don't receive State Pension payments
- Your taxable income is lower
- You may pay less tax on other income

### After Claiming

- Your State Pension is higher
- Your taxable income increases
- You may pay more tax overall

For most people, the lifetime tax impact is roughly neutral. But if you're a higher-rate taxpayer now and expect to be basic-rate in retirement, deferral could save tax.
