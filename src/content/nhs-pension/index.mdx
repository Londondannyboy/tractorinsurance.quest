## How the NHS Pension is Calculated

### 2015 Scheme Calculation

Your annual pension in the 2015 scheme is calculated as:

**Annual Pension = Sum of (Each Year's Pensionable Pay ÷ 54)**

Each year's pension is then revalued by CPI + 1.5% until you retire.

### Example Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="NHS Pension Example">
**Sarah** earns £35,000 in 2024/25. Her pension for this year:

- Pension earned: £35,000 ÷ 54 = **£648.15** per year
- This is revalued each year by CPI + 1.5% until retirement
- Over a 30-year career, her pension builds up year by year
</Callout>

### Lump Sum Option

At retirement, you can exchange some of your annual pension for a tax-free lump sum:

- Exchange rate: Give up £1 of annual pension for £12 lump sum
- Maximum: 25% of the capital value of your pension

## NHS Pension Age

Your Normal Pension Age (NPA) in the 2015 scheme is linked to your State Pension age:

<DataTable
  title="NHS Pension Normal Pension Age"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme" },
    { key: "npa", header: "Normal Pension Age", highlight: true }

  data={[
    { scheme: "1995 Section", npa: "60" },
    { scheme: "2008 Section", npa: "65" },
    { scheme: "2015 Scheme", npa: "State Pension Age (currently 66-67)" }
  ]}
/>

### Early Retirement

You can take your NHS Pension from age **55** (rising to 57 from 2028), but your pension will be reduced for early payment.

The reduction is approximately **5% per year** before your Normal Pension Age.

## McCloud Remedy

### What It Means

- You'll get a choice about which scheme's benefits to receive for the "remedy period" (April 2015 - March 2022)
- NHS Pensions will contact affected members

<Callout type="info" title="Automatic Process">
