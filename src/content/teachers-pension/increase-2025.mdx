## How the Increase Works

### For Retired Teachers

If you're already receiving your Teachers' Pension:

1. The increase is applied automatically
2. Your April 2025 payment will be at the new rate
3. No action is needed from you

### For Current Teachers

If you're still teaching and building pension:

- Your **accrued benefits** are revalued by **CPI + 1.6%**
- This is 3.3% for the 2024/25 year
- Applied to all pension you've built up so far

<Callout type="info" title="Two Types of Increase">
- **Retired teachers**: Pension increases by CPI (1.7%)
- **Working teachers**: Accrued pension revalued by CPI + 1.6% (3.3%)

## CPI vs RPI

The Teachers' Pension uses **CPI** (Consumer Prices Index) for increases, not RPI (Retail Prices Index).

  columns={[
    { key: "cpi", header: "CPI", highlight: true },
    { key: "rpi", header: "RPI" }

  rows={[
    { feature: "Used for", values: { cpi: "Teachers' Pension increases", rpi: "Some private pensions" } },
    { feature: "Typically", values: { cpi: "Lower than RPI", rpi: "Higher than CPI" } },
    { feature: "Difference", values: { cpi: "Usually 0.5-1% lower", rpi: "Usually 0.5-1% higher" } }
  ]}

<Callout type="info" title="Why CPI?">
CPI typically produces lower increases than RPI. The government switched public sector pensions to CPI in 2011 as a cost-saving measure.

## Revaluation for Working Teachers

If you're still teaching, your pension benefits are revalued differently:

### Career Average (2015 Scheme)

- Revaluation rate: **CPI + 1.6%**
- For 2024/25: 1.7% + 1.6% = **3.3%**
- Applied to all pension built up before this year

<Callout type="example" title="Revaluation Example">
**Emma** has built up £10,000 pension in the career average scheme.

At the start of 2025/26, this is revalued by 3.3%:

- Old value: £10,000
- Revalued: £10,000 × 1.033 = **£10,330**

This happens every year, compounding the value.
