## How is My State Pension Calculated?

Your State Pension amount depends on:

1. **Your National Insurance record** - How many qualifying years you have
2. **Which system you're on** - New or basic State Pension
3. **Any additional State Pension** - SERPS or State Second Pension (for basic State Pension)
4. **Contracted-out deductions** - If you were in a scheme that contracted out of the additional State Pension

### New State Pension Calculation

For the **new State Pension** (if you reached State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016):

- You need **35 qualifying years** for the full amount (£221.20/week)
- You need at least **10 qualifying years** to get anything
- Each qualifying year gives you 1/35th of the full amount

### Basic State Pension Calculation

For the **basic State Pension** (if you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016):

- You need **30 qualifying years** for the full basic amount (£169.50/week)
- You may also have Additional State Pension (SERPS/S2P) on top
- Total can exceed the new State Pension amount

## Check Your Personal State Pension Amount

The best way to find out exactly how much State Pension you'll get is to check your personal forecast:

  title="Check your State Pension"
  source="GOV.UK"

Your forecast will show:
- Your current State Pension estimate
- How many qualifying years you have
- Any gaps in your record
- How you could increase your amount

## What Affects Your State Pension Amount?

Several factors can affect how much State Pension you receive:

### 1. National Insurance Record

Your State Pension is based on National Insurance contributions and credits:

- **Working and earning** above £12,570/year (2024/25) gives you credits automatically
- **Receiving certain benefits** gives you National Insurance credits
- **Caring for children** under 12 while claiming Child Benefit gives you credits
- **Being a registered carer** can give you credits

### 2. Contracting Out

If you were "contracted out" of the additional State Pension (through a workplace pension), your State Pension may be reduced. This was common in public sector schemes and some private pensions before 2016.

<Callout type="tip" title="Check for Contracted-Out Deductions">
Your State Pension forecast will show if you have any contracted-out deductions. These reduce your State Pension because you were building up a workplace pension instead.
</Callout>

### 3. Gaps in Your Record

If you have gaps in your National Insurance record, you may be able to fill them by:

- Paying voluntary National Insurance contributions
- Claiming credits you're entitled to but haven't claimed
- Checking for errors in your record

  description="See if you have any gaps in your record"
  trusted={true}
/>

## State Pension if You've Paid Less Than 35 Years

If you have fewer than 35 qualifying years, you'll receive a proportional amount:

**Your weekly State Pension = (£221.20 ÷ 35) × your qualifying years**

For example:
- 25 years = £158.00 per week (£8,216/year)
- 20 years = £126.40 per week (£6,573/year)
- 15 years = £94.80 per week (£4,930/year)

## How State Pension Compares to Living Costs

The full new State Pension provides a basic income, but may not cover all retirement costs:
