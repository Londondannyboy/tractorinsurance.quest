The **State Pension** is a regular payment from the UK government that you can claim when you reach State Pension age. It's the foundation of retirement income for millions of people in the UK, and understanding how it works is essential for planning your future.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain everything you need to know about the State Pension - from how much you'll get to when you can claim it.

## What is the State Pension?

The State Pension is a weekly payment you receive from the government once you reach State Pension age. It's based on your National Insurance (NI) contribution record - the more qualifying years you have, the more State Pension you'll receive.

There are two types of State Pension:

1. **New State Pension** - For people who reached State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016
2. **Basic State Pension** - For people who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016

Most people reading this guide will be on the new State Pension system, which is simpler and generally more generous.

<Callout type="info" title="Which State Pension applies to you?">
If you were born on or after 6 April 1951 (men) or 6 April 1953 (women), you'll receive the new State Pension. If you were born before these dates, you're on the basic State Pension system.

## How to Qualify for State Pension

To get the **full** new State Pension, you need **35 qualifying years** of National Insurance contributions or credits.

You get a qualifying year when you:

- Work and pay National Insurance (earning above £12,570/year in 2024/25)
- Get National Insurance credits (e.g., while claiming certain benefits)
- Pay voluntary National Insurance contributions

### Minimum Qualifying Years

You need at least **10 qualifying years** to get any State Pension at all. With 10 years, you'd get 10/35ths of the full amount.

<Callout type="tip" title="Check your NI record">
You can check your National Insurance record online at GOV.UK to see how many qualifying years you have and whether you have any gaps you could fill.
</Callout>

### Can I Get State Pension If I've Never Worked?

Yes, you may still qualify through National Insurance credits. You receive credits automatically when you:

- Claim Child Benefit for a child under 12
- Claim Jobseeker's Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance
- Claim Carer's Allowance
- Are registered as a carer

## How to Claim Your State Pension

The State Pension doesn't start automatically - you need to claim it. You should receive a letter about 2 months before you reach State Pension age explaining how to claim.

You can claim:

- **Online** - The quickest method
- **By phone** - Call the Pension Service on 0800 731 7898
- **By post** - Download and send the claim form

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't delay your claim">
You can only backdate your State Pension claim for up to 12 months. If you claim late, you could lose money.
</Callout>

## Can I Defer My State Pension?

Yes, you can choose to delay (defer) claiming your State Pension. For every 9 weeks you defer, your State Pension increases by 1%. This works out to about **5.8% per year**.

**Example:** If you defer for 1 year, your £221.20 weekly pension would increase to approximately £234 per week - an extra £666 per year for life.

## State Pension and Other Income

Your State Pension counts as taxable income, but tax isn't deducted before you receive it. Whether you pay tax depends on your total income.

### State Pension and Working

You can work and receive State Pension at the same time. There's no earnings limit. However, you'll pay tax and National Insurance on your wages as normal.

### State Pension and Private Pensions

The State Pension is designed to work alongside workplace and private pensions. It provides a foundation, but most people need additional pension savings for a comfortable retirement.

## Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI)

WASPI refers to women born in the 1950s who were affected by changes to State Pension age. Many weren't given adequate notice that their pension age was increasing from 60 to 66.

The Parliamentary Ombudsman found maladministration by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in communicating these changes. Compensation recommendations are being considered.
