Starting at 25 vs 35 means 10 extra years, but over double the pot. The earlier you start, the more time compound growth has to work.

## Pension Pot Formula

### The Calculation

**Future Value = PMT × (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)**

Where:
- PMT = Monthly payment
- r = Monthly interest rate
- n = Number of months

### With Existing Pot

**Future Value = Existing Pot × (1 + r)^n + PMT × (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)**

## Example Projections

<Callout type="example" title="Example 1: Young Saver">
**Emma**, age 25, saving until 65:
- Current pot: £5,000
- Monthly contribution: £400 (including employer)
- Expected return: 5%
- Time: 40 years

**Projected pot: ~£640,000**
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Example 2: Mid-Career">
**James**, age 45, saving until 65:
- Current pot: £100,000

- Time: 20 years

**Projected pot: ~£455,000**
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Example 3: Late Starter">

## Will Your Pot Be Enough?

### Rules of Thumb

    { key: "pot", header: "Pot Needed (4% rule)", highlight: true }

### Including State Pension

Remember to factor in State Pension (~£11,500/year at full rate):

<Callout type="example" title="Income Planning">
**Target total income**: £25,000/year
**State Pension**: £11,500/year
**Income needed from pot**: £13,500/year
**Pot needed**: £13,500 × 25 = **£337,500**
</Callout>

## Boost Your Pot

### Increase Contributions

Even small increases add up:

<DataTable
  title="Impact of Extra £50/month"
  columns={[
    { key: "years", header: "Years to Retirement" },
    { key: "extra", header: "Extra Pot Value", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { years: "30 years", extra: "+£41,500" },
    { years: "20 years", extra: "+£20,500" },
    { years: "10 years", extra: "+£7,800" }
  ]}
/>

### Maximise Employer Match

If your employer matches contributions, ensure you're getting the full match - it's free money.

### Review Charges

Lower charges mean more money stays invested:

- 0.5% vs 1.5% charges = ~20% larger pot over 30 years

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What return should I assume?",
      answer: "5% is a reasonable long-term assumption for a balanced portfolio. Use lower (3-4%) for more conservative estimates, higher (6-7%) for optimistic projections."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I include inflation?",
      answer: "These projections are in 'nominal' terms. To see 'real' (inflation-adjusted) value, subtract ~2% from the return rate."
    },
    {
      question: "How much should I be saving?",
      answer: "A common rule is to save half your age as a percentage of salary. So starting at 30, save 15%. The minimum auto-enrolment (8%) is unlikely to be enough for most."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my employer matches contributions?",
      answer: "Include employer contributions in your total. If you contribute £200 and they add £100, use £300 in calculations."
    },
    {
      question: "How do charges affect my pot?",
      answer: "Significantly over time. 1% extra charges can reduce your pot by 25% or more over 30 years."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I project my workplace pension?",
      answer: "Yes, the same principles apply. Your workplace pension provider should also offer projection tools."
    }
