Understanding your **NHS Pension contributions** helps you know exactly what you're paying for one of the best pension schemes in the UK. This guide explains the contribution rates and how they're calculated.

## NHS Pension Contribution Rates 2024/25

Your contribution rate depends on your pensionable pay. From **1 October 2024**, a new tiered structure applies:

<DataTable
  title="NHS Pension Contribution Rates"
  columns={[
    { key: "tier", header: "Tier" },
    { key: "earnings", header: "Annual Pensionable Pay" },
    { key: "rate", header: "Rate", highlight: true },
    { key: "monthly", header: "Monthly (approx)" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { tier: "1", earnings: "Up to £13,246", rate: "5.1%", monthly: "Up to £56" },
    { tier: "2", earnings: "£13,247 - £16,831", rate: "5.7%", monthly: "£63 - £80" },
    { tier: "3", earnings: "£16,832 - £22,878", rate: "6.1%", monthly: "£86 - £116" },
    { tier: "4", earnings: "£22,879 - £23,948", rate: "6.8%", monthly: "£130 - £136" },
    { tier: "5", earnings: "£23,949 - £28,223", rate: "7.7%", monthly: "£154 - £181" },
    { tier: "6", earnings: "£28,224 - £29,179", rate: "8.8%", monthly: "£207 - £214" },
    { tier: "7", earnings: "£29,180 - £43,805", rate: "9.8%", monthly: "£238 - £358" },
    { tier: "8", earnings: "£43,806 - £49,245", rate: "10.0%", monthly: "£365 - £410" },
    { tier: "9", earnings: "£49,246 - £56,163", rate: "11.6%", monthly: "£476 - £543" },

    { tier: "11", earnings: "Over £72,030", rate: "13.5%", monthly: "£810+" }

## How Your Contribution is Calculated

### Step 1: Identify Your Pensionable Pay

**Pensionable pay** typically includes:

- Basic salary
- Some allowances (depending on contract)
- Unsocial hours payments (in most cases)
- Overtime (for some members)

**Not usually included**:

- Non-pensionable allowances
- Expenses
- One-off bonuses

<Callout type="info" title="Check Your Payslip">
Your payslip should show your "pensionable pay" figure. This is what's used to calculate your contribution, not your gross pay.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Find Your Tier

Look at the table above to find which tier your annual pensionable pay falls into.

### Step 3: Calculate Your Contribution

Multiply your pensionable pay by your tier's percentage rate.

### Example Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="Contribution Example">
**Tom** earns £35,000 per year in pensionable pay.

- His tier: 7 (£29,180 - £43,805)
- His rate: 9.8%
- Annual contribution: £35,000 × 9.8% = **£3,430**
- Monthly contribution: **£286** (before tax relief)
</Callout>

## Employer Contributions

Your NHS employer also contributes to your pension:

<StatGrid columns={2}>
  <StatCard
    label="Employer Rate"
    value="23.7%"
    change="Of your pensionable pay"
    icon="🏥"
    color="emerald"
  />
  <StatCard
    label="Total Contribution"
    value="Up to 37.2%"
    change="Combined rate"
    icon="💷"
    color="blue"
  />
</StatGrid>

### Total Combined Contribution

<DataTable
  title="Employee + Employer Contribution Examples"
  columns={[
    { key: "salary", header: "Salary" },
    { key: "employee", header: "Employee", align: "right" },
    { key: "employer", header: "Employer", align: "right" },
    { key: "total", header: "Total/Year", highlight: true, align: "right" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { salary: "£25,000", employee: "£1,925 (7.7%)", employer: "£5,925", total: "£7,850" },
    { salary: "£35,000", employee: "£3,430 (9.8%)", employer: "£8,295", total: "£11,725" },
    { salary: "£50,000", employee: "£5,800 (11.6%)", employer: "£11,850", total: "£17,650" },
    { salary: "£70,000", employee: "£8,750 (12.5%)", employer: "£16,590", total: "£25,340" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Value of Your Pension">
The total contribution (up to 37%) is far more than most private employers contribute. This makes the NHS Pension exceptionally valuable.
</Callout>

## Tax Relief on Contributions

You receive **tax relief** on your NHS Pension contributions. This means your pension costs less than the headline rate.

### How Tax Relief Works

NHS Pension contributions are taken from your pay **before** income tax is calculated. This gives automatic tax relief.

<DataTable
  title="Real Cost of NHS Pension After Tax Relief"
  columns={[
    { key: "rate", header: "Your Tax Rate" },
    { key: "relief", header: "Tax Relief" },
    { key: "cost", header: "Real Cost", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { rate: "Basic rate (20%)", relief: "20%", cost: "80% of contribution" },
    { rate: "Higher rate (40%)", relief: "40%", cost: "60% of contribution" },
    { rate: "Additional rate (45%)", relief: "45%", cost: "55% of contribution" }
  ]}
/>

### Tax Relief Example

<Callout type="example" title="Tax Relief Example">
**Sarah** earns £50,000 and pays higher-rate tax.

- Her contribution: £5,800 per year
- Tax relief at 40%: £2,320
- **Real cost to Sarah**: £3,480

She effectively gets a £5,800 pension contribution for £3,480.
</Callout>

## Part-Time Workers

If you work **part-time**, your contribution rate is based on your **actual earnings**, not the full-time equivalent.

### Example

<Callout type="example" title="Part-Time Example">
**Emma** works 3 days per week. Her full-time equivalent salary would be £35,000, but she actually earns £21,000.

Her contribution tier is based on **£21,000** (Tier 3 at 6.1%), not £35,000.
</Callout>

This means part-time workers often pay a lower percentage than their full-time colleagues on the same grade.

## Multiple NHS Jobs

If you have more than one NHS job:

- Each job has its own contribution rate
- Rates are based on each job's pensionable pay separately
- All jobs count towards your total pension

<Callout type="info" title="Multiple Jobs">
If your combined NHS earnings would put you in a higher tier, that doesn't affect individual job contributions. Each is calculated separately.
</Callout>

## Changes to Contribution Rates

### October 2024 Changes

The contribution structure changed in October 2024:

<DataTable
  title="What Changed"
  columns={[
    { key: "before", header: "Before Oct 2024" },
    { key: "after", header: "From Oct 2024", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { before: "7 contribution tiers", after: "11 contribution tiers" },
    { before: "Larger jumps between tiers", after: "Smaller, smoother steps" },
    { before: "Based on notional whole-time equivalent", after: "Based on actual pensionable pay" }
  ]}
/>

### Did You Win or Lose?

Most members see little change, but:

- **Some mid-earners** pay slightly less
- **Some at tier boundaries** may pay differently
- **Part-timers** may benefit from the actual pay calculation

## Contribution Holidays

You can temporarily stop contributing (opt out) and rejoin later. However, this is rarely advisable:

### Why You'd Lose Out

- No employer contributions during opt-out
- No pension growth for that period
- No death or ill-health cover

<Callout type="warning" title="Think Carefully">
Opting out loses you the 23.7% employer contribution - effectively a 23.7% pay cut in pension terms. Most financial advisers recommend staying in.
</Callout>

## Salary Sacrifice Arrangements

Some NHS employers offer **salary sacrifice** arrangements for benefits like:

- Cycle to work schemes
- Childcare vouchers
- Additional pension contributions

These **reduce your pensionable pay**, which could lower your pension contributions but also your pension benefits.

## Checking Your Contributions

### On Your Payslip

Look for:

- "Pension" or "Superannuation" deduction
- Pensionable pay figure
- Contribution rate may be shown

### On the Member Hub

The NHS Pension portal shows:

- Your contribution history
- Pensionable pay recorded
- Total contributions paid

  items={[
    {
      question: "Why is my NHS Pension contribution so high?",
      answer: "NHS Pension contributions range from 5.1% to 13.5% depending on earnings. While this seems high, remember your employer contributes 23.7% on top, and you get a guaranteed pension - making it excellent value."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I reduce my NHS Pension contributions?",
      answer: "You can only change your contribution rate by earning less. The rates are fixed by the scheme rules. You could opt out entirely, but this isn't usually advisable."
    },

      question: "Is the NHS Pension contribution rate changing?",
      answer: "The rate structure changed in October 2024. There are currently no further changes announced, but rates are reviewed periodically."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I pay National Insurance on pension contributions?",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I work extra shifts?",
      answer: "Extra shifts increase your pensionable pay, potentially moving you to a higher contribution tier. They also increase your pension benefits."
    },
    {
      question: "Are NHS Pension contributions taken from sick pay?",
      answer: "Yes, if you receive occupational sick pay that is pensionable, contributions are still taken. This also means you continue building pension."
