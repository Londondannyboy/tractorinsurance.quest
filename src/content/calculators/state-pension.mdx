### The Formula

**Your State Pension = (Your Qualifying Years ÷ 35) × £221.20 per week**

<Callout type="example" title="Calculation Example">
**Sarah** has 28 qualifying years.

- Calculation: (28 ÷ 35) × £221.20 = £177.00/week
- Annual: £177.00 × 52 = **£9,204/year**
</Callout>

## What Counts as a Qualifying Year?

A qualifying year is one where you:

This shows:

- Your actual qualifying years
- Your projected State Pension amount
- Gaps in your NI record
- When you can claim

## Filling Gaps in Your Record

If you have fewer than 35 qualifying years, you may be able to fill gaps:

### Voluntary Contributions

- **Cost**: £17.45/week per year being filled (2024/25)
- **Benefit**: Adds ~£6.32/week to your pension (~£329/year)
- **Break-even**: About 3-4 years of receiving pension

<Callout type="tip" title="Deadline Extension">
There's a temporary extension allowing you to fill gaps back to 2006. This deadline has been extended - check gov.uk for current dates.
</Callout>

### Is It Worth Filling Gaps?

  ]}
  data={[
    { cost: "~£907", gain: "£329", breakeven: "~2.8 years" }
  ]}
/>

If you live more than ~3 years after claiming, you benefit. Most people should fill gaps if they can.

## State Pension Calculation Factors

### Contracted-Out Deduction

If you were "contracted out" through a workplace pension before 2016, you may have a deduction:

- Reduces State Pension to account for pension built elsewhere
- Shown on your forecast as "Contracted Out Pension Equivalent" (COPE)

### Starting Amount

If you had NI contributions before April 2016, your starting amount is calculated using the better of:

- Old basic State Pension + Additional State Pension rules
- New State Pension rules

## Projecting Future Qualifying Years

### If You're Still Working

<Callout type="example" title="Future Years Projection">
**Tom** is 55 with 25 qualifying years. State Pension age is 67.

- Years until State Pension: 12
- Potential qualifying years: 25 + 12 = 37
- Capped at 35 years for full pension

**Projected pension**: Full £221.20/week
</Callout>

### If You're Not Working

Consider how you might continue building qualifying years:

- Claim benefits you're entitled to
- Register for Child Benefit (even if not receiving payments)
- Claim Carer's Credit if caring for someone
- Pay voluntary contributions

## State Pension FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How do I calculate my State Pension?",
      answer: "Divide your qualifying years by 35, then multiply by £221.20 to get your weekly amount. Maximum is 35 years for the full amount."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have more than 35 qualifying years?",
      answer: "Extra years above 35 don't increase your State Pension further. You're capped at the full amount of £221.20/week."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have fewer than 10 qualifying years?",
      answer: "You won't receive any State Pension. Consider paying voluntary contributions to reach the 10-year minimum."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get State Pension if I've never worked?",
      answer: "Yes, through NI credits from Child Benefit, caring, or receiving certain benefits. You need at least 10 qualifying years."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the gov.uk forecast?",
      answer: "It's based on your actual NI record and is the most accurate source. It assumes you'll continue contributing until State Pension age."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the maximum State Pension I can get?",
      answer: "The full new State Pension is £221.20/week (2024/25). Some people with pre-2016 contributions may get slightly more due to protected payments."
