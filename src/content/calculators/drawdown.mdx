## The 4% Rule Explained

The "4% rule" suggests you can withdraw 4% of your pot in year one, then adjust for inflation each year, with a high probability of lasting 30 years.

<Callout type="example" title="4% Rule Example">
**Starting pot**: £300,000
**Year 1 withdrawal**: £300,000 × 4% = £12,000
**Year 2** (2% inflation): £12,000 × 1.02 = £12,240
**Year 3**: £12,240 × 1.02 = £12,485

And so on...
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="It's a Guideline, Not a Guarantee">
The 4% rule is based on US historical data. UK retirees may need to be more conservative. Market conditions affect outcomes.

## Sustainable Withdrawal Rates

<DataTable
  title="Withdrawal Rates and Risk"
  columns={[
    { key: "rate", header: "Withdrawal Rate" },
    { key: "risk", header: "Risk Level" },
    { key: "suitable", header: "May Be Suitable For", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { rate: "3%", risk: "Low", suitable: "Very risk-averse, want pot to grow" },
    { rate: "4%", risk: "Moderate", suitable: "Standard approach, 30-year horizon" },
    { rate: "5%", risk: "Higher", suitable: "Shorter time horizon, other income sources" },
    { rate: "6%+", risk: "High", suitable: "Limited time horizon, accepting depletion" }
  ]}

## Drawdown Projection Examples

<Callout type="example" title="Example 1: Conservative Approach">
**Sarah**, age 60, pot £250,000, wants income to age 90:

- Time horizon: 30 years
- Withdrawal rate: 3.5% = **£8,750/year**
- Plus State Pension at 67: £11,500/year
- **Total from 67**: ~£20,250/year
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Example 2: Moderate Approach">
**James**, age 65, pot £400,000:

- Withdrawal rate: 4% = **£16,000/year**
- Plus State Pension: £11,500/year
- **Total income**: ~£27,500/year

If markets perform well, pot may last longer or grow.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Example 3: Higher Income Need">
**Emma**, age 70, pot £200,000, other income limited:

- Withdrawal rate: 5% = **£10,000/year**
- Plus State Pension: £10,000/year
- **Total income**: ~£20,000/year
- Pot may deplete in ~20 years (age 90)

    { return: "6%", duration4: "Indefinite", duration5: "40+ years" }

## Sequence of Returns Risk

When you take withdrawals matters as much as average returns:

<Callout type="warning" title="Early Losses Hurt Most">
If markets fall 20% in your first year of drawdown while you're withdrawing 4%, your pot takes a double hit. You've withdrawn from a smaller base, making recovery harder.
</Callout>

### Mitigating Sequence Risk

- Keep 1-3 years of income in cash/bonds
- Reduce withdrawals in down markets if possible
- Consider a "bucket strategy" (cash, bonds, equities)
- Start with lower withdrawal rate

## Income Strategies

### Level Income

- Take same amount each year
- Adjust occasionally for inflation
- Simple to manage

### Variable Income

- Take more when markets are up
- Reduce in down years
- Helps preserve pot

### Staged Approach

1. **Early retirement**: Higher drawdown from pension
2. **State Pension kicks in**: Reduce drawdown
3. **Later retirement**: Buy annuity for guaranteed income

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How much can I safely withdraw?",
      answer: "The 4% rule is a common guideline. For a 30+ year retirement, consider 3.5-4%. Adjust based on your circumstances, other income, and risk tolerance."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my pot runs out?",
      answer: "This is the key risk of drawdown. You'd rely on State Pension and any other income. Regular reviews and conservative withdrawal rates reduce this risk."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use drawdown or buy an annuity?",
      answer: "Many use both - drawdown for flexibility and an annuity for guaranteed baseline income. Consider your need for security vs flexibility."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I review my drawdown?",
      answer: "At least annually. Check pot performance, review withdrawal rate, adjust for inflation, and consider whether annuity makes sense for part of your pot."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my mind with drawdown?",
      answer: "Yes, drawdown is flexible. You can change withdrawal amounts, stop withdrawals, or buy an annuity with remaining funds."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my drawdown pot when I die?",
      answer: "It can pass to beneficiaries. If you die before 75, it's usually tax-free. After 75, beneficiaries pay income tax on withdrawals."
