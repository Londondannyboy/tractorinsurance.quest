**Early retirement** from the NHS is possible, but it comes with significant pension reductions. This guide explains your options and helps you understand the financial impact.

## When Can You Retire?

### Minimum Pension Age

<StatGrid columns={2}>
  <StatCard
    label="Current Minimum"
    value="55"
    change="Until April 2028"
    icon="📅"
    color="blue"

    value="57"

  />
</StatGrid>

### Normal Pension Age (NPA)

Your NPA depends on which scheme you're in:

<DataTable
  title="Normal Pension Ages"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme" },
    { key: "npa", header: "Normal Pension Age", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scheme: "1995 Section", npa: "60" },
    { scheme: "2008 Section", npa: "65" },
    { scheme: "2015 Scheme", npa: "State Pension Age (66-68)" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="State Pension Age">
For the 2015 scheme, your NPA is linked to State Pension age. Currently this is 66, rising to 67 between 2026-2028, with further increases possible.
</Callout>

## Early Retirement Reductions

If you retire before your NPA, your pension is **reduced** to account for the longer payment period.

### Reduction Rates

  columns={[
    { key: "years", header: "Years Before NPA" },
    { key: "reduction", header: "Approximate Reduction", highlight: true },
    { key: "receive", header: "You Receive" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { years: "1 year", reduction: "~5%", receive: "95%" },
    { years: "2 years", reduction: "~10%", receive: "90%" },
    { years: "3 years", reduction: "~14%", receive: "86%" },
    { years: "5 years", reduction: "~22%", receive: "78%" },
    { years: "7 years", reduction: "~30%", receive: "70%" },
    { years: "10 years", reduction: "~40%", receive: "60%" }
  ]}
  caption="Actual reductions depend on exact age and scheme. These are approximate."
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Reductions Are Permanent">
Early retirement reductions apply for life. Your pension doesn't increase to the full amount later - it remains reduced throughout retirement.
</Callout>

### How Reductions Are Calculated

The reduction factors are actuarially calculated to account for:

- More years of pension payments
- Fewer years of contributions/growth
- Life expectancy assumptions

## Early Retirement Examples

### Example 1: Retiring 5 Years Early

<Callout type="example" title="Early Retirement at 62">
**Sarah** has an NHS Pension of £25,000/year at her NPA of 67. She wants to retire at 62.

- Years early: 5
- Reduction: ~22%
- Reduced pension: £25,000 × 0.78 = **£19,500/year**

**Annual loss**: £5,500/year
**Over 20 years**: £110,000 less pension income
</Callout>

### Example 2: Retiring at 55

<Callout type="example" title="Retiring at Minimum Age">
**James** is in the 2015 scheme with NPA 67. His projected pension at NPA is £30,000/year. He wants to retire at 55.

- Years early: 12
- Reduction: ~47%
- Reduced pension: £30,000 × 0.53 = **£15,900/year**

This is almost half his full pension.
</Callout>

## Partial Retirement Options

You don't have to fully retire. There are flexible options:

### Wind Down (Partial Retirement)

You can take some of your pension while continuing to work:

- Draw part of your pension (with early payment reductions)
- Continue working and building more pension
- Gradually transition to full retirement

<Callout type="info" title="Wind Down Rules">
You must reduce your pensionable pay by at least 10% to use wind down. The pension you draw is reduced for early payment.
</Callout>

### Retire and Return

You can fully retire, then return to NHS work:

- Take your full pension (with any early reductions)
- Return to NHS employment
- Build a new pension in the 2015 scheme
- Subject to annual allowance limits

### Step Down

Reduce your hours or role:

- Lower salary means less pension growth
- But maintains employment and income
- Can delay touching your pension

## Multiple Scheme Benefits

If you have benefits in different schemes (1995, 2008, 2015), each part has its own NPA:

<DataTable
  title="Drawing Different Scheme Benefits"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme" },
    { key: "npa", header: "NPA" },
    { key: "draw", header: "When to Draw", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scheme: "1995 Section", npa: "60", draw: "Can draw from 55 (reduced) or 60 (full)" },
    { scheme: "2008 Section", npa: "65", draw: "Can draw from 55 (reduced) or 65 (full)" },
    { scheme: "2015 Scheme", npa: "SPA", draw: "Can draw from 55 (reduced) or SPA (full)" }
  ]}
/>

### Strategy: Staggered Retirement

You could:

1. Draw 1995 benefits at 60 (no reduction)
2. Draw 2008 benefits at 65 (no reduction)
3. Draw 2015 benefits at SPA (no reduction)

This avoids early retirement reductions but means waiting longer for some benefits.

## Should You Retire Early?

### Questions to Consider

<DataTable
  title="Early Retirement Considerations"
  columns={[
    { key: "question", header: "Question" },
    { key: "consider", header: "What to Consider", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { question: "Can you afford the reduction?", consider: "Reduced pension is permanent" },
    { question: "What's your health like?", consider: "Poor health may favour earlier retirement" },
    { question: "Do you have other income?", consider: "Savings, partner's income, other pensions" },
    { question: "What's your life expectancy?", consider: "Family history, health factors" },
    { question: "Will you work elsewhere?", consider: "Earnings could supplement reduced pension" },
    { question: "What are your living costs?", consider: "Mortgage, debts, lifestyle expenses" }
  ]}
/>

### The Break-Even Point

If you retire early, you receive more payments but each is smaller. The break-even point is typically around **age 82-85**:

- Before that age: Early retirement gives you more total pension
- After that age: Waiting would have given you more total pension

<Callout type="tip" title="Think Long-Term">
Average life expectancy at 65 is about 20 years. If you're in good health, waiting for your full pension often pays off in total lifetime income.
</Callout>

## Early Retirement Protection

### Mental Health Officers

Some staff in specific roles have protected early retirement ages:

- Special class status (pre-1995)
- Mental health officer status

These protections are limited and closed to new entrants.

### Ill Health Retirement

If you're too ill to work, you may qualify for **ill health retirement**:

- **Tier 1**: Enhanced pension if you may work again someday
- **Tier 2**: Significantly enhanced pension if you'll never work again

This is different from voluntary early retirement - no early payment reductions apply.

## FAQs

  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What is the earliest I can take my NHS Pension?",
      answer: "Currently age 55, rising to 57 from April 2028. However, taking your pension this early means significant reductions - potentially 40% or more."
    },
    {
      question: "How much will my pension be reduced by?",
      answer: "Approximately 5% per year before your Normal Pension Age. Request a retirement quote from NHS Pensions for your exact figures."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take early retirement and keep working?",
      answer: "Yes, through retire and return. You take your pension (with reductions), then return to NHS work and build a new pension."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my pension increase after I've taken it early?",
      answer: "The early retirement reduction is permanent. However, your pension will still increase annually with inflation (CPI)."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have benefits in different schemes?",
      answer: "Each scheme's benefits have different Normal Pension Ages. You can draw them at different times to minimise or avoid reductions."
    },
    {
      question: "Is early retirement ever a good idea?",
      answer: "It depends on your circumstances. If you have other income, health concerns, or really want to stop working, the reduction may be acceptable. Consider the lifetime impact carefully."
