  ]}

### 4. Any Contracted-Out Deductions

If you were in a pension scheme that was "contracted out" of the Additional State Pension, this will be shown as a deduction.

## Understanding Your Forecast

### What "Forecast" Means

Your forecast is an **estimate**, not a guarantee. It assumes:

- You'll continue working and paying National Insurance until State Pension age
- Current State Pension rates (adjusted for inflation)
- No changes to the rules

<Callout type="info" title="Forecast vs Reality">
Your actual State Pension could be different if you stop working early, take career breaks, or the rules change.

  ]}

## How to Increase Your State Pension

If your forecast is lower than you'd like, you may be able to increase it:

### 1. Continue Working

Each additional year of work (earning above £12,570) adds to your qualifying years, up to 35.

### 2. Fill Gaps with Voluntary Contributions

You can pay voluntary National Insurance contributions to fill gaps in your record:

- **Cost**: £17.45 per week (2024/25) per missing year
- **Benefit**: Adds approximately £6.32 per week to your State Pension
- **Time limit**: Usually past 6 years, but some years can be filled until 2025

### 3. Claim Missing Credits

You might be entitled to National Insurance credits you haven't claimed for:

- Caring for someone 20+ hours per week
- Receiving certain benefits
- Being a grandparent caring for grandchildren

## Checking Your National Insurance Record

Your NI record shows exactly which years count towards your State Pension:

  description="See your full NI contribution history"
  trusted={true}
/>

### What to Look For

- **Full years**: Show a tick or say "Full"
- **Partial years**: May be worth filling with voluntary contributions
- **Gaps**: Years with no contributions at all

## When to Check Your Forecast

Consider checking your State Pension forecast:

- **In your 50s**: Gives time to fill gaps if needed
- **10 years before retirement**: Plan your retirement income
- **After major life changes**: Career break, divorce, moving abroad
- **If you're self-employed**: Ensure you're paying enough NI
