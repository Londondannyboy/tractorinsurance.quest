### What Changed?

The October 2024 changes introduced:

- **More tiers**: 11 contribution tiers instead of 7
- **Smoother progression**: Smaller jumps between bands
- **Lower rates for some**: Some mid-earners pay slightly less

<Callout type="info" title="Your Contribution Rate">
Your contribution rate is based on your actual pensionable pay, not your full-time equivalent. If you work part-time, your tier is based on your actual earnings.
</Callout>

## McCloud Remedy Implementation

The **McCloud remedy** continues to be implemented throughout 2025. This addresses age discrimination in how members were moved to the 2015 scheme.

### Timeline

<DataTable
  title="McCloud Remedy Timeline"
  columns={[
    { key: "date", header: "Date" },
    { key: "event", header: "Event", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { date: "October 2023", event: "Remedy came into effect" },
    { date: "2024-2025", event: "Remediable Service Statements issued" },
    { date: "Throughout 2025", event: "Deferred Choice exercises begin" },
    { date: "Ongoing", event: "Immediate Choice for retiring members" }
  ]}
/>

### Who's Affected?

You're affected by McCloud if you:

- Were a member of the 1995 or 2008 scheme on **31 March 2012**
- Were not within 10 years of your Normal Pension Age on that date
- Have service in the **remedy period** (1 April 2015 - 31 March 2022)

<StatGrid columns={2}>
  <StatCard

    label="Members Affected"
    value="~1.3m"
    change="NHS staff"
    icon="👥"
    color="emerald"
  />
</StatGrid>

### What Choices Do You Have?

For the remedy period, you'll choose whether to receive benefits under:

- **Legacy scheme** (1995 or 2008 section) - typically better for higher earners or those close to retirement
- **Reformed scheme** (2015 scheme) - may be better for career average earners

<Callout type="important" title="You'll Be Contacted">
NHS Pensions will contact affected members with their Remediable Service Statement and choice options. You don't need to do anything until you receive your statement.
</Callout>

## Annual Allowance Changes

The **Annual Allowance** - the maximum you can save into pensions tax-efficiently each year - remains at **£60,000** for 2024/25 and expected into 2025/26.

### Key Points

- Standard Annual Allowance: **£60,000**
- Tapered AA for high earners: Can reduce to **£10,000**
- Money Purchase Annual Allowance: **£10,000** (if you've flexibly accessed DC pensions)

    change="Per year"

  <StatCard
    label="Carry Forward"
    value="3 Years"
    change="Unused allowance"
    icon="➡️"
    color="blue"
  />
</StatGrid>

### Tapered Annual Allowance

If your **threshold income** exceeds £200,000 and **adjusted income** exceeds £260,000, your Annual Allowance is reduced:

- £1 reduction for every £2 of adjusted income over £260,000
- Minimum tapered allowance: £10,000

<Callout type="warning" title="High Earners">
If you're a senior NHS consultant or manager, check your Annual Allowance position carefully. The NHS Pension growth can exceed the Annual Allowance, resulting in tax charges.
</Callout>

## Lifetime Allowance Abolition

The **Lifetime Allowance** (LTA) was abolished from **6 April 2024**. This is a significant positive change for NHS staff with large pensions.

### What This Means

- No more LTA tax charges on pension benefits
- No limit on how much pension you can build up
- Previous LTA protections no longer needed (but keep records)

### New Limits

While the LTA is gone, new limits apply:

<DataTable
  title="New Pension Limits"
  columns={[
    { key: "limit", header: "Limit" },
    { key: "amount", header: "Amount", highlight: true },
    { key: "notes", header: "Notes" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { limit: "Lump Sum Allowance", amount: "£268,275", notes: "Max tax-free lump sum" },
    { limit: "Lump Sum & Death Benefit Allowance", amount: "£1,073,100", notes: "Combined limit" }
  ]}
/>

## Pension Revaluation 2025

Your NHS Pension benefits are revalued each year. For the **2015 scheme**, benefits increase by **CPI + 1.5%**.

### 2025 Revaluation

- September 2024 CPI: **1.7%**
- Revaluation rate: **3.2%** (1.7% + 1.5%)
- Applied to: All 2015 scheme accrued benefits from April 2025

<Callout type="info" title="How Revaluation Works">
Each year's pension you've built up is increased. This compounds over time, so earlier years get multiple revaluations before you retire.
</Callout>

### Pension Increase for Pensioners

If you're already receiving your NHS Pension, it increases each April by CPI:

- April 2025 increase: Based on September 2024 CPI of **1.7%**

## No Changes to Employer Contribution

The **employer contribution rate** remains at **23.7%** of pensionable pay. This hasn't changed and isn't expected to change in 2025.

<StatGrid columns={2}>
  <StatCard
    label="Employer Contribution"
