Understanding how your **Civil Service Pension** is calculated helps you plan for retirement. This guide explains the calculation methods for different schemes.

## Alpha Scheme Calculation

Most civil servants are in **alpha**, which uses Career Average:

<StatGrid columns={3}>
  <StatCard
    label="Accrual Rate"
    value="2.32%"
    change="Per year of service"
    icon="📊"
    color="blue"
  />
  <StatCard
    label="Revaluation"
    value="CPI"
    change="Applied annually"
    icon="📈"
    color="emerald"
  />
  <StatCard
    label="Normal Pension Age"
    value="SPA"
    change="State Pension Age"
    icon="🎂"
    color="violet"
  />
</StatGrid>

### Alpha Formula

**Annual Pension = Pensionable Earnings × 2.32%**

Each year's pension is then revalued by CPI until retirement.

### Step-by-Step Alpha Calculation

<DataTable
  title="Example: Building Pension Over Time"
  columns={[
    { key: "year", header: "Year" },
    { key: "salary", header: "Salary", align: "right" },
    { key: "pension", header: "Pension Earned", highlight: true, align: "right" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "Year 1", salary: "£30,000", pension: "£696" },
    { year: "Year 2", salary: "£32,000", pension: "£742" },
    { year: "Year 3", salary: "£35,000", pension: "£812" },
    { year: "Year 4", salary: "£38,000", pension: "£882" },
    { year: "Year 5", salary: "£40,000", pension: "£928" }
  ]}
  caption="Each year's pension = Salary × 2.32%"
/>

### Revaluation Example

<Callout type="example" title="CPI Revaluation">
If you earned £696 pension in Year 1 and CPI is 2%:

- After 1 year: £696 × 1.02 = £710
- After 2 years: £710 × 1.02 = £724
- And so on...

This compounding protects against inflation.

  columns={[
    { key: "years", header: "Years of Service" },
    { key: "s30", header: "£30k Avg", align: "right" },

    { key: "s50", header: "£50k Avg", align: "right" },
    { key: "s60", header: "£60k Avg", align: "right" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { years: "10 years", s30: "~£8,000", s40: "~£11,000", s50: "~£14,000", s60: "~£16,000" },
    { years: "20 years", s30: "~£16,000", s40: "~£22,000", s50: "~£27,000", s60: "~£33,000" },
    { years: "30 years", s30: "~£25,000", s40: "~£33,000", s50: "~£41,000", s60: "~£50,000" },
    { years: "35 years", s30: "~£29,000", s40: "~£38,000", s50: "~£48,000", s60: "~£58,000" }
  ]}

## Classic Scheme Calculation

If you have benefits in **classic** (pre-2002 joiners):

### Classic Formula

**Annual Pension = Final Pensionable Salary × Years × 1/80**

Plus automatic lump sum of 3× annual pension.

<Callout type="example" title="Classic Example">
**John** has 20 years in classic, final salary £45,000:

- Pension: £45,000 × 20 × 1/80 = **£11,250/year**
- Auto lump sum: £11,250 × 3 = **£33,750**
</Callout>

## Premium Scheme Calculation

For **premium** members (joined 2002-2007):

### Premium Formula

**Annual Pension = Final Pensionable Salary × Years × 1/60**

No automatic lump sum, but can exchange pension for lump sum.

<Callout type="example" title="Premium Example">
**Sarah** has 15 years in premium, final salary £50,000:

- Pension: £50,000 × 15 × 1/60 = **£12,500/year**
</Callout>

## Nuvos Scheme Calculation

For **nuvos** members (joined 2007-2015):

### Nuvos Formula

**Annual Pension = Each Year's Earnings × 2.3%**

Revalued by CPI (similar to alpha but slightly lower accrual).

## Multiple Scheme Benefits

If you have service in multiple schemes, each part is calculated separately:

<Callout type="example" title="Combined Benefits">
**Emma** has service in classic, premium, and alpha:

- Classic (10 years, final £40k): £40,000 × 10/80 = £5,000/year + £15,000 lump sum
- Premium (5 years, final £40k): £40,000 × 5/60 = £3,333/year
- Alpha (15 years, avg £45k): 15 × £45,000 × 2.32% = £15,660/year (before revaluation)

**Total**: ~£24,000/year pension + £15,000 lump sum
</Callout>

## Lump Sum Options

At retirement, you can exchange pension for a tax-free lump sum:

<DataTable
  title="Lump Sum Exchange"
  columns={[
    { key: "pension", header: "Annual Pension" },
    { key: "exchange", header: "Give Up" },
    { key: "lump", header: "Receive", highlight: true },
    { key: "remaining", header: "Remaining Pension" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { pension: "£20,000", exchange: "£2,000", lump: "£24,000", remaining: "£18,000" },
    { pension: "£30,000", exchange: "£3,000", lump: "£36,000", remaining: "£27,000" },
    { pension: "£40,000", exchange: "£5,000", lump: "£60,000", remaining: "£35,000" }
  ]}
  caption="Exchange rate: £1 pension = £12 lump sum"
/>

## Early Retirement Reductions

Retiring before Normal Pension Age reduces your pension:

<BarChart

  subtitle="Approximate pension reduction by years early"
  data={[
    { label: "1 year early", value: 5, color: "bg-amber-400" },
    { label: "2 years early", value: 9, color: "bg-amber-500" },
    { label: "3 years early", value: 13, color: "bg-orange-500" },
    { label: "5 years early", value: 21, color: "bg-orange-600" },
    { label: "10 years early", value: 38, color: "bg-red-500" }

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How accurate are Civil Service Pension calculators?",
      answer: "Online estimates are approximations. For accurate figures, use My Civil Service Pension portal which has your actual contribution history."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have benefits in multiple schemes?",
      answer: "Each scheme's benefits are calculated separately using that scheme's rules. They're added together at retirement."
    },
    {
      question: "Does overtime count in my pension?",
      answer: "Generally no for alpha. It uses 'pensionable earnings' which is typically basic pay. Check with your employer."
    },
    {
      question: "How is part-time service calculated?",
      answer: "Alpha uses actual earnings, so part-time builds pension at your actual salary level, not full-time equivalent."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I buy extra pension?",
      answer: "Yes, you can purchase Added Pension through the scheme. Cost depends on age and amount."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the maximum pension I can get?",
      answer: "There's no maximum. With the Lifetime Allowance abolished, your pension depends only on salary and service length."
    }
