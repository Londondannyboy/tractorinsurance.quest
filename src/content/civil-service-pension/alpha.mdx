## How Alpha Builds Your Pension

### The Basic Formula

**Annual Pension = Pensionable Earnings × 2.32%**

Each year, you earn 2.32% of your pensionable pay as pension. This accumulates throughout your career.

### Example Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="Alpha Pension Building">
**Sarah** earns £35,000 this year.

Her pension earned for this year:
- £35,000 × 2.32% = **£812** per year

This is added to her pension pot and revalued by CPI each year.
</Callout>

### Revaluation

Each year's pension is increased by **CPI** (Consumer Prices Index) at the start of every April until you retire.

<Callout type="example" title="Revaluation Example">
If Sarah earned £812 pension in Year 1 and CPI is 2%:

- After 1 year: £812 × 1.02 = £828
- After 2 years: £828 × 1.02 = £845
- And so on...

This compounding protects your pension against inflation.
