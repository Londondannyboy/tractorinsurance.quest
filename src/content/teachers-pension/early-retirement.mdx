**Early retirement** from teaching is possible, but it comes with pension reductions. This guide explains your options and the financial impact.

## When Can You Retire?

### Minimum Pension Age

<StatGrid columns={2}>
  <StatCard
    label="Current Minimum"
    value="55"
    change="Until April 2028"
    icon="📅"

</StatGrid>

### Normal Pension Age (NPA)

Your NPA depends on which scheme you're in:

<DataTable
  title="Normal Pension Ages"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme" },
    { key: "npa", header: "Normal Pension Age", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scheme: "Final Salary (pre-2007)", npa: "60" },
    { scheme: "Final Salary (2007-2015)", npa: "65" },
    { scheme: "Career Average (2015)", npa: "State Pension Age (66-68)" }
  ]}
/>

## Early Retirement Reductions

Retiring before your NPA means your pension is **reduced** to account for longer payment duration.

## Early Retirement Examples

### Example 1: Retiring 5 Years Early

<Callout type="example" title="Early Retirement at 62">
**Emma** has a Teachers' Pension of £25,000/year at NPA 67. She wants to retire at 62.

- Years early: 5
- Reduction: ~22%
- Reduced pension: £25,000 × 0.78 = **£19,500/year**

**Annual loss**: £5,500
**Over 20 years**: £110,000 less pension income
</Callout>

### Example 2: Retiring at 55

<Callout type="example" title="Retiring at Minimum Age">
**James** has NPA 67 and projected pension of £30,000. He wants to retire at 55.

- Years early: 12
- Reduction: ~47%
- Reduced pension: £30,000 × 0.53 = **£15,900/year**

This is nearly half his full pension.
</Callout>

## Phased Retirement

Teachers can take a **phased retirement** - drawing some pension while continuing to work:

### How It Works

1. Reduce your working hours by at least 20%
2. Draw part of your pension (with early reductions if applicable)
3. Continue building pension on remaining work
4. Take full retirement when ready

### Benefits

- Gradual transition to retirement
- Income from both pension and salary
- Continue accruing pension on remaining service

<Callout type="info" title="Phased Retirement Rules">
You must have reached age 55 (57 from 2028) and be employed as a teacher. Your employer must agree to the reduced hours.
</Callout>

## Actuarially Reduced Benefits (ARB)

If you leave teaching but want to access your pension early, you can request **Actuarially Reduced Benefits**:

- Available from age 55 (57 from 2028)
- Pension reduced to reflect early payment
- You don't need to have left teaching completely

## Multiple Scheme Benefits

If you have benefits in different scheme versions:

<DataTable
  title="Drawing Different Scheme Benefits"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme" },
    { key: "npa", header: "NPA" },
    { key: "draw", header: "Options", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { scheme: "Final Salary (pre-2007)", npa: "60", draw: "Draw at 60 without reduction" },
    { scheme: "Final Salary (2007-2015)", npa: "65", draw: "Draw at 65 without reduction" },
    { scheme: "Career Average (2015)", npa: "SPA", draw: "Draw at SPA without reduction" }
  ]}
/>

### Staggered Retirement Strategy

You could:

1. Draw pre-2007 benefits at 60 (no reduction)
2. Draw 2007-2015 benefits at 65 (no reduction)
3. Draw 2015 benefits at SPA (no reduction)

This avoids early retirement reductions but means waiting longer for some benefits.

## Should You Retire Early?

### Questions to Consider

<DataTable
  title="Early Retirement Considerations"
  columns={[
    { key: "question", header: "Question" },
    { key: "consider", header: "What to Consider", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { question: "Can you afford the reduction?", consider: "Reduced pension is permanent" },
    { question: "What's your health like?", consider: "Poor health may favour earlier retirement" },
    { question: "Do you have other income?", consider: "Savings, partner's income, other pensions" },
    { question: "What's your life expectancy?", consider: "Family history, health factors" },
    { question: "Will you work elsewhere?", consider: "Earnings could supplement pension" }
  ]}
/>

### The Break-Even Point

The break-even point is typically around **age 82-85**:

- Before that: Early retirement gives more total pension
- After that: Waiting would have given more total pension

<Callout type="tip" title="Think Long-Term">
Average life expectancy at 65 is about 20 years. If healthy, waiting for full pension often pays off.
</Callout>

## Ill Health Retirement

If you're too ill to teach, you may qualify for **ill health retirement**:

- **Total incapacity**: Enhanced pension if you can never work
- **Partial incapacity**: Pension based on service to date

This is different from voluntary early retirement - no early payment reductions apply.
