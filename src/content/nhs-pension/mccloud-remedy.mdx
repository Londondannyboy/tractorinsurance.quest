The **McCloud remedy** is the government's solution to age discrimination that occurred when public sector pension schemes, including the NHS Pension, were reformed in 2015. This guide explains everything NHS staff need to know.

## What is the McCloud Remedy?

In 2015, the government moved public sector workers from their old pension schemes (like the 1995 and 2008 NHS schemes) to new schemes (the 2015 NHS scheme). However, older workers closer to retirement were "protected" and allowed to stay in the old schemes.

In 2018, the **McCloud judgment** ruled this protection was **age discrimination** - younger workers were treated less favourably simply because of their age.

### The Remedy

To fix this, the government is giving affected members a **choice**:

- Receive **legacy scheme** benefits (1995 or 2008) for the remedy period, OR
- Receive **reformed scheme** benefits (2015) for the remedy period

You get to pick whichever gives you the better outcome.

## Are You Affected?

You're affected by the McCloud remedy if you:

<DataTable
  title="McCloud Eligibility"
  columns={[
    { key: "criteria", header: "Criteria" },
    { key: "requirement", header: "Requirement", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { criteria: "Scheme membership", requirement: "Member of 1995 or 2008 scheme on 31 March 2012" },
    { criteria: "Not fully protected", requirement: "Not within 10 years of NPA on 1 April 2012" },
    { criteria: "Remedy period service", requirement: "Have service between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2022" },
    { criteria: "Gap condition", requirement: "No gap of more than 5 years in NHS scheme membership" }
  ]}
/>

### Who's NOT Affected?

- Members who joined the NHS Pension after 1 April 2012
- Members who were fully protected (stayed in legacy scheme throughout)
- Members with no service during the remedy period

<Callout type="info" title="Check Your Position">
If you're unsure whether you're affected, you'll receive a **Remediable Service Statement** from NHS Pensions if you are. You can also check the NHS Pension Member Hub.
</Callout>

## The Remedy Period

The "remedy period" is **1 April 2015 to 31 March 2022** - seven years.

### What Happens For This Period?

For your service during these seven years, you choose which scheme's rules apply:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Legacy vs Reformed Scheme"
  columns={[
    { key: "legacy", header: "Legacy (1995/2008)", highlight: true },
    { key: "reformed", header: "Reformed (2015)" }
  ]}
  rows={[
    { feature: "Pension type", values: { legacy: "Final salary", reformed: "Career average (CARE)" } },
    { feature: "Accrual rate", values: { legacy: "1/80th (1995) or 1/60th (2008)", reformed: "1/54th" } },
    { feature: "Based on", values: { legacy: "Final pensionable pay", reformed: "Actual pay each year" } },
    { feature: "Normal Pension Age", values: { legacy: "60 (1995) or 65 (2008)", reformed: "State Pension Age" } },
    { feature: "Auto lump sum", values: { legacy: "Yes (1995 only)", reformed: "No" } }
  ]}
/>

## Which Scheme is Better?

There's no universal answer - it depends on your individual circumstances.

### Legacy Scheme (1995/2008) May Be Better If:

- You had **significant salary increases** after the remedy period
- You were in the **1995 scheme** (earlier NPA of 60)
- Your **final salary** is much higher than your remedy period salaries
- You value the **automatic lump sum** (1995 scheme)

### Reformed Scheme (2015) May Be Better If:

- Your salary was **relatively stable**
- Your pay during the remedy period was **higher than your final salary** (due to reduced hours later, for example)
- You had good **salary growth during the remedy period**
- The **CPI + 1.5% revaluation** benefits you

<Callout type="tip" title="You Don't Have to Guess">
Your Remediable Service Statement will show you the value of both options. NHS Pensions calculates both so you can make an informed choice.
</Callout>

## Types of Choice

There are two types of McCloud choice:

### 1. Immediate Choice (Retiring Members)

If you're **retiring** or have already retired:

- You make your choice when claiming benefits
- NHS Pensions shows you both options
- You choose which is better
- Decision is final once benefits are paid

### 2. Deferred Choice (Still Working)

If you're **still working** or haven't yet claimed:

- You'll receive a Remediable Service Statement
- No immediate decision needed
- You make your choice when you eventually claim benefits
- This allows time for the full picture to emerge

<DataTable
  title="Immediate vs Deferred Choice"
  columns={[
    { key: "type", header: "Choice Type" },
    { key: "when", header: "When to Decide", highlight: true },

  data={[
    { type: "Immediate Choice", when: "At retirement/claim", who: "Already retired or retiring now" },
    { type: "Deferred Choice", when: "When you eventually retire", who: "Still working/not yet claimed" }
  ]}
/>

## Remediable Service Statements

NHS Pensions is issuing **Remediable Service Statements** (RSS) to affected members:

### What the Statement Shows

- Confirmation you're affected by McCloud
- Your service during the remedy period
- **Estimated benefits under both schemes**
- Information about making your choice

### Timeline

  columns={[
    { key: "date", header: "Date" },
    { key: "event", header: "Event", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { date: "October 2023", event: "McCloud remedy came into effect" },
    { date: "2024-2025", event: "Remediable Service Statements being issued" },
    { date: "Throughout 2025", event: "Continued RSS distribution" },
    { date: "At retirement", event: "Immediate Choice for retiring members" },
    { date: "Future", event: "Deferred Choice when you retire" }
  ]}

<Callout type="important" title="Wait For Your Statement">
Don't try to calculate your McCloud position yourself. Wait for your Remediable Service Statement which will have accurate figures based on your actual service and earnings.
</Callout>

## Tax Implications

The McCloud remedy may have tax implications:

### Annual Allowance

- Your pension growth in the remedy period may be recalculated
- This could affect Annual Allowance charges you've already paid
- If you overpaid AA charges, you may be due a refund
- If legacy scheme results in higher growth, you may owe additional tax

### Scheme Pays

If you used "scheme pays" for Annual Allowance charges during the remedy period, this will be reviewed.

<Callout type="info" title="Compensation for Losses">
If you suffered financial loss due to being moved to the 2015 scheme (e.g., paid more tax, reduced pension), you may be entitled to compensation. NHS Pensions will contact affected members.
</Callout>

## What You Need to Do

### Right Now

**Nothing immediate** for most members:

1. **Keep your contact details updated** with NHS Pensions
2. **Watch for correspondence** about your RSS
3. **Don't make hasty decisions** - wait for full information

### When You Receive Your RSS

1. **Read it carefully** - understand both options
2. **Compare the figures** - which gives better benefits?
3. **Consider future changes** - will your salary change significantly?
4. **Seek advice if needed** - for complex cases

### When Retiring

1. **Make your choice** - legacy or reformed for remedy period
2. **Complete required forms** - NHS Pensions will guide you
3. **Decision is final** - once benefits are taken, you can't change

## McCloud and Partial Retirement

If you're considering **partial retirement** (drawing some benefits while continuing to work):

- Your McCloud choice applies to the benefits you're drawing
- You may be asked to choose for the portion being taken
- Consider whether to wait until full retirement for clarity
