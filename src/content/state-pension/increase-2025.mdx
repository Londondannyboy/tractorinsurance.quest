## What is the Triple Lock?

The **triple lock** is a government commitment that the State Pension will increase each April by the highest of:

1. **Average earnings growth** (measured July-September)
2. **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation** (September figure)
3. **2.5%** (a guaranteed minimum)

<DonutChart

    { label: "Earnings Growth", value: 4.1, color: "#10b981" },

    { label: "Minimum", value: 2.5, color: "#94a3b8" }
  ]}
  centerValue="4.1%"
  centerLabel="Highest = Used"
/>

For April 2025, average earnings growth of **4.1%** was the highest, so this became the increase.

<Callout type="info" title="Triple Lock Maintained">
The government confirmed in the Autumn Budget 2024 that the triple lock will be maintained for the current Parliament, protecting pensioner incomes against inflation.
</Callout>

## How Much Extra Will You Get?

The 4.1% increase means different extra amounts depending on how much State Pension you currently receive:

## When Will You See the Increase?

The new rates take effect from the first Monday of the new tax year:

- **New rates start:** Monday 7 April 2025
- **First payment at new rate:** Depends on your payment day

You don't need to do anything - the increase is automatic.

<Callout type="tip" title="Check Your First Payment">
Your first payment at the new rate will depend on when your State Pension is normally paid. Check your bank statement after 7 April to confirm the increase.
</Callout>

## Is the Triple Lock Safe?

The triple lock has been controversial due to its cost. Here's the current situation:

### Arguments For Keeping It

- Protects pensioners against inflation
- State Pension is still modest compared to average wages
- Pensioners have fixed incomes and can't earn more
- Many pensioners have no other income

### Arguments Against

- Very expensive for taxpayers (£2-3 billion per 1%)
- Some pensioners are relatively wealthy
- Working-age benefits don't have the same protection
- May be unsustainable long-term

<Callout type="info" title="Government Commitment">
The current government has committed to maintaining the triple lock for the duration of this Parliament. However, future governments could change this.
</Callout>

## State Pension vs Inflation

Despite the triple lock, there are concerns about whether the State Pension keeps pace with actual living costs:
