## Quick Eligibility Check

### Do You Qualify?

<DataTable
  title="Basic Eligibility"
  columns={[
    { key: "criteria", header: "Criteria" },
    { key: "requirement", header: "Requirement", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { criteria: "Age", requirement: "State Pension age or over" },
    { criteria: "Residence", requirement: "Living in England, Scotland or Wales" },
    { criteria: "Income", requirement: "Below guarantee credit threshold" },
    { criteria: "Savings", requirement: "Not automatically excluded (savings considered)" }
  ]}
/>

## How to Calculate Your Entitlement

### Step 1: Add Up Your Weekly Income

Include:

- State Pension
- Other pensions (workplace, private)
- Most benefits
- Earnings (some disregarded)

### Step 2: Compare to the Guarantee Credit

<DataTable
  title="Pension Credit Calculation"
  columns={[
    { key: "status", header: "Your Status" },
    { key: "guarantee", header: "Guarantee Level" },
    { key: "calculation", header: "Calculation", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { status: "Single", guarantee: "£218.15/week", calculation: "£218.15 minus your income" },
    { status: "Couple", guarantee: "£332.95/week", calculation: "£332.95 minus your income" }
  ]}
/>

### Step 3: Consider Savings

- Savings under £10,000: No effect on Pension Credit
- Savings over £10,000: £1/week deducted for every £500 over £10,000
- No upper savings limit (unlike some benefits)

## Calculation Examples

<Callout type="example" title="Example 1: Single Person">
**Margaret** is single with:
- State Pension: £180/week
- Small private pension: £20/week
- Savings: £8,000

**Calculation**:
- Total income: £200/week
- Guarantee level: £218.15
- Savings under £10,000: No deduction
- **Pension Credit: £18.15/week** (£944/year)
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Example 2: Couple">
**John and Mary** are a couple with:
- Combined State Pension: £350/week
- Savings: £15,000

**Calculation**:
- Total income: £350/week
- Guarantee level: £332.95
- Income exceeds guarantee: **Not eligible for Guarantee Credit**

However, they may still qualify for **Savings Credit** (see below).
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Example 3: With Savings">
**Robert** is single with:
- State Pension: £150/week
- No other pension
- Savings: £18,000

**Calculation**:
- Total income: £150/week
- Savings over £10,000: £8,000 excess
- Savings deduction: £8,000 ÷ £500 = £16/week
- Deemed income: £150 + £16 = £166/week
- **Pension Credit: £218.15 - £166 = £52.15/week**
</Callout>

## Savings Credit

If you (or your partner) reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016, you may also qualify for **Savings Credit**:

- Rewards modest savings/income above basic State Pension
- Maximum: £17.01/week (single) or £19.04/week (couple)
- Complex calculation - use official calculator

## Additional Amounts

Your Pension Credit may be higher if you have:

    },
    {
      question: "Will my savings affect Pension Credit?",
      answer: "Savings under £10,000 don't affect it. Over £10,000, £1/week is deducted for every £500 above. There's no upper limit that disqualifies you."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get Pension Credit if I have a private pension?",

    },
    {
      question: "How far back can I claim Pension Credit?",

    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to claim every year?",

      question: "Can my partner's income affect my claim?",
      answer: "Yes, couples are assessed together. Your combined income is compared to the couples' guarantee level."
