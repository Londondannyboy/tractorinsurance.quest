Your **State Pension age** is the earliest age you can start claiming your State Pension. It's not automatic - you need to claim it, and you can even choose to delay (defer) for a higher payment.

## Current State Pension Age

The State Pension age is currently **66** for both men and women. This applies if you were born before 6 April 1960.

If you were born after this date, your State Pension age will be higher due to planned increases.

<Callout type="info" title="State Pension Age Equalisation">
The State Pension age for women used to be 60, while men's was 65. Between 2010 and 2020, women's State Pension age gradually increased to match men's at 65, then both increased to 66.

## Can I Take My State Pension Early?

**No**, you cannot take your State Pension before you reach State Pension age. Unlike workplace or personal pensions (which you can access from age 55/57), the State Pension has a fixed start date.

However, you have other options if you need income before State Pension age:

- Access your workplace or personal pensions from age 55 (rising to 57 in 2028)
- Continue working
- Claim benefits if eligible (e.g., Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance)

## Can I Delay My State Pension?

**Yes**, you can defer your State Pension and receive a higher amount when you do claim. For every 9 weeks you defer, your State Pension increases by 1%.

This works out to approximately **5.8% per year**.

### Example of Deferral

<StatGrid columns={2}>
  <StatCard
    label="Claim at 66"
    value="£221.20/week"
    icon="📅"
    color="blue"
  />
  <StatCard
    label="Defer 1 year"
    value="£234.03/week"
    icon="⏰"
    color="emerald"
  />
</StatGrid>

By deferring for one year, you'd receive an extra £12.83 per week (£667/year) for life.

## State Pension Age and WASPI

Many women born in the 1950s were affected by the rapid increase in State Pension age from 60 to 66. The Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) campaign argues these women weren't given adequate notice.

In March 2024, the Parliamentary Ombudsman found that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was guilty of maladministration in how it communicated these changes.
