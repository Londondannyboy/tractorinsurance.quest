The Civil Service Pension is a **defined benefit** (DB) pension scheme for UK civil servants and employees of participating employers. It's administered by **MyCSP** (My Civil Service Pension).

Key features include:

- **Guaranteed pension** based on your salary and service
- **Employer contributions** of up to 30.3% on top of yours
- **Tax relief** on your contributions
- **Death benefits** for your dependants

## How the Civil Service Pension is Calculated

### Alpha Scheme Calculation

Your annual pension in alpha is calculated as:

**Annual Pension = Sum of (Each Year's Pensionable Earnings × 2.32%)**

Each year's pension is then revalued by CPI until you retire.

### Example Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="Civil Service Pension Example">
**James** earns £40,000 in 2024/25. His pension for this year:

- Pension earned: £40,000 × 2.32% = **£928** per year
- This is revalued each year by CPI until retirement
- Over a 30-year career, his pension builds up year by year
</Callout>

### Lump Sum Option

At retirement, you can exchange some of your annual pension for a tax-free lump sum:

- Exchange rate: Give up £1 of annual pension for £12 lump sum
- Maximum: 25% of the capital value of your pension

## Civil Service Pension Age

Your Normal Pension Age (NPA) depends on which scheme you're in:

<DataTable
  title="Civil Service Pension Normal Pension Age"
  columns={[
    { key: "scheme", header: "Scheme" },
    { key: "npa", header: "Normal Pension Age", highlight: true }
  ]}

    { scheme: "Classic", npa: "60" },
    { scheme: "Premium", npa: "60" },
    { scheme: "Classic Plus", npa: "60" },
    { scheme: "Nuvos", npa: "65" },
    { scheme: "Alpha", npa: "State Pension Age (currently 66-68)" }
  ]}
/>

### Early Retirement

You can take your Civil Service Pension from age **55** (rising to 57 from 2028), but your pension will be reduced for early payment.
