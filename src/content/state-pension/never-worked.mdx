Good news: you don't have to have worked to receive the **State Pension**. You can build up qualifying years through National Insurance credits, which are free and given automatically in many situations.

## How to Qualify Without Working

The State Pension is based on your National Insurance (NI) record. While most people build this through working and paying NI contributions, you can also qualify through **National Insurance credits**.

### Ways to Get NI Credits

## Child Benefit and State Pension

If you've claimed **Child Benefit** for a child under 12, you automatically receive National Insurance credits for each year of claim.

<Callout type="important" title="Even If You Don't Receive Payments">
If your household income is over £60,000, you may have opted out of receiving Child Benefit payments to avoid the High Income Child Benefit Charge. However, you should still **register** for Child Benefit to get the NI credits - just tick the box to not receive payments.
</Callout>

### Example: Stay-at-Home Parent

**Sarah** has never worked but:
- Claimed Child Benefit for her three children for 25 years total
- This gives her 25 qualifying years
- She'd receive approximately £158/week in State Pension (25/35 × £221.20)

## Carer's Allowance and State Pension

If you care for someone for **20 or more hours per week**, you may be entitled to:

1. **Carer's Allowance** (£81.90/week in 2024/25) - if they receive certain disability benefits
2. **Carer's Credit** - National Insurance credits even if you don't qualify for Carer's Allowance

### Carer's Credit

If you're caring for someone but don't qualify for Carer's Allowance (perhaps because you receive another benefit), you can apply for **Carer's Credit**:

## Grandparent Childcare Credits

If you're a grandparent (or other family member) who looks after a child under 12 so their parent can work, you may be able to claim **Specified Adult Childcare credits**.

### How It Works

1. The child's parent must be working
2. The parent transfers their NI credit to you
3. You get a qualifying year towards your State Pension

## Benefits That Give NI Credits

Receiving these benefits automatically gives you NI credits:

## Minimum Qualifying Years

To receive **any** State Pension, you need at least **10 qualifying years**.

## What If I Don't Have Enough Years?

If you don't have 10 qualifying years, you may be able to:

### 1. Pay Voluntary Contributions

You can pay Class 3 voluntary National Insurance (£17.45/week per year) to buy additional qualifying years.

### 2. Claim Credits You've Missed

Check if you're entitled to credits you haven't claimed:
- Carer's Credit for past caring
- Credits for fostering
- Credits for jury service

### 3. Continue Building Credits

If you're under State Pension age, keep building credits through:
- Claiming benefits you're entitled to
- Registering as a carer
- Claiming Child Benefit

## Your Partner's State Pension

Your State Pension is individual - you can't share or inherit your partner's State Pension entitlement while they're alive.

However, if your partner dies, you may be able to inherit some of their State Pension, depending on:
- When they reached State Pension age
- Their National Insurance record
- Whether they deferred their pension
