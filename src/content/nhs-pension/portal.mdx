## What You Can Do in the Portal

The Member Hub gives you access to several key functions:

<StatGrid columns={3}>
  <StatCard
    label="View Pension"
    value="Estimates"
    change="See your projected pension"
    icon="📊"
    color="blue"
  />

    value="Quotes"
    change="Retirement estimates"
    icon="📋"
    color="violet"
  />
</StatGrid>

### 1. View Your Pension Estimate

The portal shows your **Total Reward Statement** including:

- Your current pension value
- Projected pension at Normal Pension Age
- Years of pensionable service
- Your contribution history

<Callout type="tip" title="Estimate vs Reality">
The portal estimate assumes you'll continue working until your Normal Pension Age. Your actual pension will differ if you retire early, reduce hours, or leave the NHS.
</Callout>

### 2. Annual Benefit Statement

Each year, NHS Pensions produces an **Annual Benefit Statement** (ABS) showing:

- Your pension benefits as at 31 March
- Death benefits payable
- Any contracted-out deductions
- Your qualifying service

Access your ABS through: **My pension > Documents > Annual Benefit Statement**

### 3. Update Personal Details

You can update:

- **Address**: Keep this current for important correspondence
- **Bank details**: For when you start receiving pension payments
- **Nomination of beneficiaries**: Who receives your death benefits

<Callout type="warning" title="Keep Details Updated">
Out-of-date contact details could mean you miss important correspondence about your pension, including McCloud remedy information.
</Callout>

### 4. Nominate Beneficiaries

You can nominate who receives your **lump sum death benefit**:

- Navigate to: **My pension > Nominations**
- Add beneficiaries with their details
- Specify percentage for each person
- Update anytime as circumstances change

<Callout type="important" title="Nomination Importance">
If you don't nominate, NHS Pensions decides who receives your lump sum. Nominating ensures your wishes are followed.
</Callout>

### 5. Request Retirement Quotes

When you're thinking about retirement, request a quote showing:

- Your pension at different retirement ages
- Lump sum options
- Early retirement reductions (if applicable)
- Impact of part-time work

**How to request**: My pension > Retirement > Request an estimate

### 6. McCloud Remedy Information

The portal now includes McCloud remedy information:

- Your **Remediable Service Statement** (when issued)
- Options for the remedy period
- Comparison of legacy vs reformed scheme benefits
