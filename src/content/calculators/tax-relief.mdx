## How Tax Relief Works

When you contribute to a pension, the government adds money through tax relief:

### How It Actually Works

<Callout type="example" title="Higher Rate Taxpayer Example">
**James** earns £60,000 (higher rate) and contributes £200/month:

**At source (automatic)**:
- He pays: £200
- Provider claims 20%: £50
- Into pension: £250/month

**Via self-assessment**:
- Extra 20% relief on £250: £50
- This reduces his tax bill by £50/month

**Real cost to James**: £200 - £50 = £150
**In his pension**: £250
**Effective boost**: 67%

## Salary Sacrifice Extra Savings

If your employer offers **salary sacrifice**, you save even more:

  columns={[
    { key: "saving", header: "Saving" },
    { key: "rate", header: "Rate" },
    { key: "example", header: "On £100 Sacrificed", highlight: true }

  data={[
    { saving: "Employee NI", rate: "12%", example: "+£12" },
    { saving: "Employer NI", rate: "13.8%", example: "Often added to pension" }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Salary Sacrifice Benefits">
With salary sacrifice, a higher rate taxpayer could see £100 gross become £100 in pension, but only cost them ~£52 in take-home pay. Ask your employer if it's available.

## Annual Allowance

There's a limit on how much tax relief you can receive:

    { type: "Money Purchase AA", amount: "£10,000", notes: "If you've flexibly accessed DC pension" },
    { type: "Carry forward", amount: "3 years", notes: "Use unused allowance from previous years" }
  ]}

## Claiming Higher/Additional Rate Relief

### Automatic Relief (Everyone)

- 20% relief is added automatically by your pension provider
- No action needed
- Shows as the "gross" contribution

### Extra Relief (Higher Earners)

If you pay higher or additional rate tax:

1. **Via self-assessment**: Declare pension contributions on tax return
2. **Adjustment to tax code**: HMRC adjusts your tax code to give relief through PAYE
3. **Contact HMRC**: Can request adjustment if not doing self-assessment

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How do I claim higher rate tax relief?",
      answer: "Through self-assessment tax return, or by asking HMRC to adjust your tax code. The relief is given as a reduction in your tax bill."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I get tax relief on employer contributions?",
      answer: "Employer contributions are made gross (no tax relief needed) and don't count towards your personal contributions, but do count towards Annual Allowance."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't pay tax?",
      answer: "You still get 20% relief on contributions up to £2,880/year (giving £3,600 in pension). This is called 'relief at source'."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit on tax relief?",
      answer: "Yes, the Annual Allowance is £60,000 (or 100% of earnings if lower). Excess contributions face a tax charge."
    },
    {
      question: "Does tax relief apply to all pension types?",
      answer: "Yes, workplace pensions, SIPPs, and personal pensions all qualify. Some public sector schemes work differently (net pay)."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between relief at source and net pay?",
      answer: "Relief at source: You pay net, provider claims 20%. Net pay: Contributions taken before tax, so relief is automatic. Higher earners claim extra either way."
