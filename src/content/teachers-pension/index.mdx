## How the Teachers' Pension is Calculated

### Career Average Calculation

Your annual pension in the current scheme is calculated as:

**Annual Pension = Sum of (Each Year's Pensionable Earnings ÷ 57)**

Each year's pension is then revalued by CPI + 1.6% until you retire.

### Example Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="Teachers' Pension Example">
**Emma** earns £35,000 in 2024/25. Her pension for this year:

- Pension earned: £35,000 ÷ 57 = **£614.04** per year
- This is revalued each year by CPI + 1.6% until retirement
- Over a 30-year career, her pension builds up year by year
</Callout>

### Lump Sum Option

At retirement, you can exchange some of your annual pension for a tax-free lump sum:

- Exchange rate: Give up £1 of annual pension for £12 lump sum
- Maximum: 25% of the capital value of your pension

## Teachers' Pension Age

Your Normal Pension Age (NPA) in the current scheme is linked to your State Pension age:

  ]}
