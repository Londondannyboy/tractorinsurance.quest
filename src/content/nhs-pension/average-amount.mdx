## How to Calculate Your Expected Pension

### 2015 Scheme Formula

**Annual Pension = Total Pensionable Pay ÷ 54 (per year of service)**

With revaluation at CPI + 1.5% applied each year.

### Quick Estimate

For a rough estimate:

1. **Take your average career salary**
2. **Multiply by years of service**
3. **Divide by 54**
4. **Add approximately 30-50%** for revaluation (depending on career length)

<Callout type="example" title="Quick Calculation Example">
**Anna** has worked 25 years with average salary of £35,000:

- Basic calculation: (£35,000 × 25) ÷ 54 = £16,204
- With revaluation (~40%): £16,204 × 1.4 = **~£22,685**

This is approximate - actual pension depends on year-by-year salary and CPI.
