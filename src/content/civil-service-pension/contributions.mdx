## How Your Contribution is Calculated

### Step 1: Identify Your Pensionable Salary

**Pensionable salary** typically includes:

- Basic salary
- Some allowances (check with your department)
- Contractual payments

**Usually not included**:

- Overtime
- Expenses
- Performance bonuses

<Callout type="info" title="Check Your Payslip">
Your payslip shows your "pensionable pay" figure used to calculate contributions.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Find Your Contribution Tier

Look at the table above to find which tier your salary falls into.

### Step 3: Calculate Your Contribution

Multiply your pensionable salary by your tier's percentage rate.

### Example Calculation

<Callout type="example" title="Contribution Example">
**Emma** earns £45,000 per year.

- Her tier: 2 (£25,050 - £56,999)
- Her rate: 5.45%
- Annual contribution: £45,000 × 5.45% = **£2,453**
- Monthly contribution: **£204** (before tax relief)
</Callout>

## Employer Contributions

Your employer contributes significantly more than you do:

## Tax Relief on Contributions

You receive **tax relief** on your contributions, reducing the real cost.

### How Tax Relief Works

Contributions are taken from pay **before** income tax, giving automatic relief.

<DataTable
  title="Real Cost After Tax Relief"
  columns={[
    { key: "rate", header: "Your Tax Rate" },
    { key: "relief", header: "Tax Relief" },
    { key: "cost", header: "Real Cost", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { rate: "Basic rate (20%)", relief: "20%", cost: "80% of contribution" },
    { rate: "Higher rate (40%)", relief: "40%", cost: "60% of contribution" },
    { rate: "Additional rate (45%)", relief: "45%", cost: "55% of contribution" }
  ]}
/>

### Tax Relief Example

<Callout type="example" title="Tax Relief Example">
**James** earns £60,000 and pays higher-rate tax.

- His contribution: £4,410 per year
- Tax relief at 40%: £1,764
- **Real cost to James**: £2,646

He gets a £4,410 pension contribution for £2,646.
</Callout>

## Part-Time Workers

If you work **part-time**, your contribution rate is based on your **actual earnings**, not full-time equivalent.

<Callout type="example" title="Part-Time Example">
**Sarah** works 0.6 FTE. FTE salary would be £40,000, actual is £24,000.

Her contribution tier is based on **£24,000** (Tier 1 at 4.6%), not £40,000.
</Callout>

## Partnership Pension Account

Some civil servants are in **Partnership** instead of alpha:

- Defined contribution scheme
- Your contributions go into a pension pot
- Employer contributes based on age
- Different contribution structure

<DataTable
  title="Partnership Age-Related Contributions"
  columns={[
    { key: "age", header: "Your Age" },
    { key: "employer", header: "Employer Contributes", highlight: true }
  ]}
  data={[
    { age: "Under 21", employer: "8%" },
    { age: "21-25", employer: "9%" },
    { age: "26-30", employer: "10%" },
    { age: "31-35", employer: "11%" },
    { age: "36-40", employer: "12%" },
    { age: "41-45", employer: "13.5%" },
    { age: "46 and over", employer: "14.75%" }
  ]}
/>

## Opting Out

You can opt out, but it's rarely advisable:

### What You'd Lose

- Employer contribution of up to 30%
- Death benefits
- Ill health protection
- Guaranteed pension

<Callout type="warning" title="Think Carefully">
Opting out loses you massive employer contributions. Most advisers strongly recommend staying in.
</Callout>
