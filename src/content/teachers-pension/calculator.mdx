Understanding how your **Teachers' Pension** is calculated helps you plan for retirement. This guide explains the calculation method and helps you estimate your future pension.

## How the Career Average Scheme Works

Most teachers are in the **Career Average Revalued Earnings** (CARE) scheme introduced in 2015:

<StatGrid columns={3}>
  <StatCard
    label="Accrual Rate"
    value="1/57th"

  <StatCard

</StatGrid>

### The Basic Formula

**Annual Pension = Pensionable Earnings ÷ 57**

This applies each year. Your total pension is the sum of each year's pension, with revaluation applied.

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Work Out Each Year's Pension

For each year of service, divide your pensionable earnings by 57.

<DataTable
  title="Example: Building Pension Over Time"
  columns={[
    { key: "year", header: "Year" },
    { key: "salary", header: "Salary", align: "right" },
    { key: "pension", header: "Pension Earned", highlight: true, align: "right" }
  ]}
  data={[
    { year: "Year 1", salary: "£30,000", pension: "£526" },
    { year: "Year 2", salary: "£32,000", pension: "£561" },
    { year: "Year 3", salary: "£34,000", pension: "£596" },
    { year: "Year 4", salary: "£36,000", pension: "£632" },
    { year: "Year 5", salary: "£38,000", pension: "£667" }
  ]}
  caption="Each year's pension = Salary ÷ 57"
/>

### Step 2: Apply Revaluation

Each year's pension is increased by **CPI + 1.6%** at the start of every tax year.

<Callout type="example" title="Revaluation Example">
If you earned £526 pension in Year 1 and CPI is 2%:

- After 1 year: £526 × 1.036 = £545
- After 2 years: £545 × 1.036 = £565
- And so on...

This compounding significantly increases early-career pension value.

### Step 3: Add Up All Years

Your total pension is the sum of all revalued years' pension.

## Teachers' Pension Examples

### Example 1: Main Scale Teacher

<Callout type="example" title="Emma's Career">
**Emma** works for 35 years, starting at £30,000 and finishing at £45,000.

Average career salary: ~£38,000

- Basic pension: ~35 × (£38,000 ÷ 57) = **~£23,300** (simplified)
- With revaluation: **~£28,000 - £32,000** per year

*Actual calculation accounts for each year individually.*
</Callout>

### Example 2: Senior Leader

<Callout type="example" title="James's Career">
**James** is a Deputy Head. He works for 30 years, with average salary of £60,000.

- Basic pension: ~30 × (£60,000 ÷ 57) = **~£31,600** (simplified)
- With revaluation: **~£38,000 - £42,000** per year
</Callout>

### Example 3: Part-Time Teacher

<Callout type="example" title="Part-Time Example">
**Sarah** works 0.6 FTE for 25 years. FTE salary is £40,000, actual is £24,000.

Her pension is based on actual earnings:
- Basic pension: ~25 × (£24,000 ÷ 57) = **~£10,500** (simplified)
- With revaluation: **~£13,000 - £15,000** per year

Part-time service is calculated at actual salary, not full-time equivalent.
