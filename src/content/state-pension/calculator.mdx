A **State Pension calculator** helps you estimate how much State Pension you'll receive when you retire. Here's how to calculate your State Pension and understand what affects your amount.

## Official State Pension Calculator

The most accurate way to calculate your State Pension is using the official GOV.UK service. It uses your actual National Insurance record to give you a personalised forecast.

Your official forecast will show:
- Your estimated State Pension amount
- Your State Pension age
- How many qualifying years you have
- Whether you can increase your amount

## Quick State Pension Estimate

The quick estimate assumes you're on the new State Pension and have no contracted-out deductions. Your actual amount may differ. Always check your official forecast for accuracy.

## How to Check Your Qualifying Years

To calculate your State Pension accurately, you need to know your qualifying years:

  href="https://www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record"
  title="Check your National Insurance record"
  source="GOV.UK"
  description="See how many qualifying years you have"
  trusted={true}
/>

You get a qualifying year when you:

1. **Work and pay NI** on earnings above £12,570/year (2024/25)
2. **Receive NI credits** while claiming certain benefits
3. **Claim Child Benefit** for a child under 12
4. **Pay voluntary contributions** to fill gaps

## What Affects Your State Pension Amount?

Several factors can increase or decrease your State Pension:

### Factors That Can Increase Your Amount

  <StatCard
    label="More NI Years"
    value="+£6.32"
    change="per week per year"
    changeType="positive"
    icon="📈"

    change="extra for life"
    changeType="positive"

  />
</StatGrid>

### Factors That Can Decrease Your Amount

- **Contracted-out periods** - Reduced if you were in a workplace scheme that contracted out
- **Fewer than 35 qualifying years** - Proportionally less
- **Gaps in your NI record** - Missing years mean less pension

## How to Increase Your State Pension

If your forecast is lower than you'd like, you may be able to increase it:

### 1. Fill Gaps with Voluntary Contributions

You can pay voluntary National Insurance (Class 3) to fill gaps from the past 6 years. This costs £17.45 per week (2024/25) per missing year.

**Is it worth it?** Generally yes if:
- You're close to retirement
- You have fewer than 35 qualifying years
- You'll live long enough to benefit (typically 3-4 years of pension to break even)

### 2. Claim Credits You're Entitled To

You may be missing credits you could claim for:
- Caring for someone 20+ hours per week
- Being unemployed and looking for work
- Illness or disability

### 3. Defer Your State Pension

Delaying your State Pension increases it by **1% for every 9 weeks** you defer (about 5.8% per year).

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Full State Pension

**Sarah, 64, has worked continuously for 40 years**

- Qualifying years: 40 (35+ means full pension)
- Weekly amount: £221.20
- Annual amount: £11,502.40

### Example 2: Partial State Pension

**Tom, 63, has 28 qualifying years**

- Weekly amount: (£221.20 ÷ 35) × 28 = **£177.00**
- Annual amount: £9,202

Tom could fill 7 years of gaps at £17.45/week × 52 = £907 per year to get the full amount.

### Example 3: With Contracted-Out Deduction

**Jane, 65, has 35 years but was contracted out for 15 years**

- Starting amount: £221.20
- Contracted-out deduction: -£30.00 (example)
- Weekly amount: **£191.20**

These are simplified examples. Your actual State Pension depends on your specific NI record, any SERPS/S2P built up, and contracted-out adjustments. Always check your official forecast.

## State Pension Calculator FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "How do I calculate my State Pension?",
      answer: "The best way is to check your official forecast on GOV.UK which uses your actual National Insurance record. For a quick estimate, divide £221.20 by 35 and multiply by your qualifying years."
    },
    {
      question: "How many NI years do I need for full State Pension?",
      answer: "You need 35 qualifying years for the full new State Pension (£221.20/week). You need at least 10 years to receive any State Pension."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get State Pension if I've only worked 10 years?",
      answer: "Yes, 10 years is the minimum. With 10 qualifying years, you'd receive about £63.20 per week (10/35ths of the full amount)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my State Pension forecast lower than expected?",
      answer: "Your forecast may be lower due to: fewer than 35 qualifying years, contracted-out deductions from a workplace pension, or gaps in your National Insurance record."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it worth paying voluntary NI contributions?",
      answer: "Often yes. Each year you buy costs about £907 and adds £6.32/week (£328/year) to your pension. You'd break even in about 3 years of receiving pension."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the State Pension calculator?",
      answer: "The official GOV.UK forecast is very accurate as it uses your actual NI record. It assumes you'll continue contributing until State Pension age."
