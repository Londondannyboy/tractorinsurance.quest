If you retire before State Pension age, you'll have a gap:

**Age 60-67 (7 year gap)**:
- Workplace pension (reduced): £18,000/year
- No State Pension: £0
- **Total**: £18,000/year

**From age 67**:
- Workplace pension: £18,000/year
- State Pension: £11,500/year
- **Total**: £29,500/year

## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I take State Pension early?",

    },
    {
      question: "How much will early retirement reduce my pension?",
      answer: "Typically 4-6% per year before Normal Pension Age for DB schemes. Check your specific scheme for exact reduction factors."
    },
    {
      question: "Is early retirement worth it financially?",
      answer: "Usually not from a pure money perspective - you receive less over your lifetime. But quality of life, health, and personal circumstances often outweigh pure finances."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the earliest I can access my pension?",
      answer: "Private pensions: age 55 (57 from 2028). State Pension: State Pension age only. Some public sector schemes have earlier ages for certain roles."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I retire early and still work part-time?",

    },
    {
      question: "What about inflation in early retirement?",
      answer: "A long retirement means more exposure to inflation. Ensure your income includes inflation-protected elements (State Pension, some DB schemes) or factor in growing expenses."
