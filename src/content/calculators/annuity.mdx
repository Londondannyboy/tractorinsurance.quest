## FAQs

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions"
  items={[
    {
      question: "What annuity rate can I get?",
      answer: "Rates depend on age, health, and options. At 65, expect roughly £6,500 per £100,000 for a basic single-life level annuity. Shop around as rates vary."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my annuity after buying?",
      answer: "No, annuities are generally irreversible. You're locked into your choice, which is why it's crucial to consider carefully and shop around."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get a level or escalating annuity?",
      answer: "Level gives more now but loses value to inflation. Escalating protects buying power but starts lower. Consider how important maintaining value is to you."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my annuity when I die?",
      answer: "With single life, it stops. With joint life, your partner continues receiving income. A guarantee period pays to your estate for that period."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to buy an annuity?",
      answer: "No, you can use drawdown, take cash, or combine approaches. Annuities are one option for securing guaranteed income."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I buy an annuity?",
      answer: "Rates improve with age, so delaying can mean better rates. However, you miss income in the meantime. Many use drawdown early, then buy an annuity later for security."
