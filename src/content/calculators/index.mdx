    },
    {
      question: "What's the best pension calculator?",
      answer: "It depends what you need. For State Pension, use the official GOV.UK forecast. For pot projections, try MoneyHelper or our calculators."

    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "What information do I need for pension calculations?",
      answer: "Typically: current pot value, contribution amounts, expected retirement age, salary, and for State Pension, your NI record."
    },
    {
      question: "Can calculators tell me if I'm saving enough?",
