## How the Increase Works

### For Retired Civil Servants

If you're already receiving your pension:

1. The increase is applied automatically
2. Your April 2025 payment will be at the new rate
3. No action is needed from you

### For Current Civil Servants

If you're still working and building pension:

- Your **alpha accrued benefits** are revalued by **CPI**
- This is 1.7% for the 2024/25 year
- Applied to all pension you've built up so far

<Callout type="info" title="Alpha Revaluation">
Alpha uses CPI for revaluation (unlike some schemes that use CPI + 1.6%). Your accrued pension increases by CPI each year until you retire.

## When Will You See the Increase?

### Checking Your New Amount

1. Login to My Civil Service Pension
2. Check your pension record
3. Or wait for your April payslip showing the new amount

## Increases by Scheme

## Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)

If you have a **GMP** element from contracting out before 1997:

- GMP increases are handled differently
- Part may be increased by the scheme, part by State Pension
- The overall increase should still be approximately CPI

<Callout type="info" title="GMP Complexity">
GMP increases can be complex. Check with MyCSP if you have questions about your specific increase.
</Callout>

## Partnership Account

If you're in **Partnership** (defined contribution):

- There's no automatic increase
- Your pension pot grows based on investment returns
- You choose how to draw income in retirement
